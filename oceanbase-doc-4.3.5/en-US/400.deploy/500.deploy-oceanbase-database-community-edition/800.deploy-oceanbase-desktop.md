## Procedure

:::tab

tab Windows operating system

### Step 1: Install dependencies

To install OceanBase Desktop on a Windows operating system, you need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL is a feature released by Microsoft in 2016 for Windows 10. It allows you to run ELF-format Linux executable files on the Windows operating system.

Currently, two generations of WSL are available: WSL 1 and WSL 2. WSL 1 provides a Linux compatibility layer that translates Linux system calls into Windows NT system calls. WSL 2, on the other hand, leverages Windows Hyper-V functionality to run Linux virtual machines through virtualization technology, providing a more native Linux experience.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>WSL 2 is not an upgraded version of WSL 1. Therefore, you do not need to install WSL 1 before installing WSL 2. OceanBase Desktop images can only be used with WSL 2.</p>
</main>

1. Check if virtualization is enabled.

   Press [Win] + [Q] on your keyboard, search for **Task Manager**, and open it. Navigate to the **Performance** tab and check the **CPU** section. As shown in the image below, if virtualization is enabled, the **Virtualization** field will show **Enabled**. If it shows **Disabled**, follow the instructions below to enable virtualization in the BIOS.

   ![Virtualization](https://obportal.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/doc/img/OceanBase-Database-EN/3-install-win-1-virtualization.png)

2. Enable virtualization.

   This section uses a ThinkPad (a Lenovo brand) as an example to show how to access the BIOS and enable virtualization. The steps may vary slightly depending on your computer brand. For detailed instructions, visit the official website of your computer manufacturer, such as [Dell](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-sg/000195978/how-to-enable-or-disable-hardware-virtualization-on-dell-systems?lwp=rt), [Lenovo](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht500006-how-to-enable-virtualization-technology-on-lenovo-computers), [ThinkPad](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht500006-how-to-enable-virtualization-technology-on-lenovo-computers), [HP](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/ish_5637142-5637191-16), and [Huawei](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/content/en-us15777885/). You can also search online for instructions specific to your computer model.

   1. Open the **Start** menu, click the **Power** button, and select **Restart**.

   2. As your computer restarts, immediately press the **F1** key to access the BIOS settings.

   3. In the BIOS page, navigate to the **Security** option and select **Security Virtualization**.

   4. On the settings page, toggle the option next to **Virtualization Technology** to **Enabled**.

   5. After making changes, click **Save and Exit** to save your modifications and exit the BIOS settings. Wait for the system to reboot.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>After enabling virtualization, you can repeat the steps in the first section to verify that virtualization is now enabled.</p>
   </main>

3. Enable the WSL and virtual machine platform features.

   There are two methods to enable the WSL and virtual machine platform features. Choose the method based on your needs.

   * Method 1: Enable the features using command lines

     Press [Win] + [Q] on your keyboard, search for **powershell** or **Windows Powershell**, click **Run as Administrator**, and enter the following commands in the opened command line. After both commands are executed successfully, restart your computer.

     ```shell
     # Enable the WSL feature
     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

     # Enable the virtual machine platform feature
     dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
     ```

   * Method 2: Enable the features using the graphical interface

     Press [Win] + [R] on your keyboard, type `optionalfeatures`, and click **OK** to open the **Windows Features** window. Alternatively, press [Win] + [Q], search for **Turn Windows features on or off**, and click to open the **Windows Features** window. Scroll down, check the boxes for **Virtual Machine Platform** and **Windows Subsystem for Linux**, then click **OK**. Restart your computer to apply the changes.

     ![Configuration](https://obportal.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/doc/img/OceanBase-Database-EN/3-install-win-2-config.png)

4. Install the WSL 2 kernel component.

   You can click [Download](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/download-center/opensource/obdesktop/4.3.5.0/wsl.2.5.7.0.x64.msi) to get the `wsl.2.5.7.0.x64.msi` file, or visit the WSL [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL) to find the necessary WSL installation package. After the download finishes, double-click the file to launch the installer, and then follow the step-by-step instructions by clicking **Next** to complete the installation.

5. Set WSL 2 as the default version.

   Enter the following command in the cmd or powershell window:

   ```shell
   wsl --set-default-version 2
   ```

6. Verify the installation.

   In the cmd or powershell command line, enter the following command:

   ```shell
   wsl --version
   ```

   If the output appears as shown below, with the `WSL version` displayed as `2.xxx`, it indicates that WSL 2 has been successfully installed.

   ```shell
   WSL version: 2.5.7.0
   Kernel version: 6.6.87.1-1
   WSLg version: 1.0.66
   MSRDC version: 1.2.6074
   Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
   DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
