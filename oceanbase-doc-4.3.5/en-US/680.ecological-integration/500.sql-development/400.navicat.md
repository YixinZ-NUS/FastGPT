# Connect to OceanBase Database by using Navicat

Navicat is a universal database client. It connects to a database through the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver provided by this database. It supports normal relational databases, non-relational databases, and distributed databases.

You can connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database by using the OceanBase or MySQL driver that comes with Navicat. This topic describes how to connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database by using the OceanBase driver of Navicat.

## Prerequisites

* You have downloaded and installed Navicat. You can download the Navicat installation package for your operating system from the [Navicat Premium](https://www.navicat.com/en/company/press/107-pres) website.

* The IP address of the OBServer node to be connected has access to the server where Navicat is installed.

* You have installed OceanBase Database and created a MySQL tenant.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Obtain the OceanBase Database connection string

Contact the deployment personnel or administrator of OceanBase Database to obtain the connection string. The following is a connection string example:

```
obclient -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

**The parameters are described as follows:**

* `$host`: the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. It is the IP address of OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) for connection through ODP, or the IP address of an OBServer node for direct connection.
* `$port`: the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
* `$database_name`: the name of the database to be accessed.

        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>The user for connecting to a tenant must have the <code>CREATE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>DROP</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> privileges on the database. For more information about user privileges, see <a href="../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md">Privilege types in MySQL mode</a>. </p>
    </main>

* `$user_name`: the tenant account. For connection through ODP, two account formats are supported: `username@tenant name#cluster name` and `cluster name:tenant name:username`. For direct connection, the `username@tenant name` format is supported.
* `$password`: the password of the account.

For more information about the connection string, see [Connect to an OceanBase Database tenant by using OBClient](../../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/300.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-mysql-mode.md).

**Here is an example:**

```shell
obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -utest_user001@mysql001 -p****** -Dtest
```

### Step 2: Connect to OceanBase Database from the Navicat console

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
       <h4>Note</h4>
       <p>You can connect to OceanBase Database by using an IP address or ODP. When you use an IP address, enter the port number specified by the <code>mysql_port</code> parameter. The default port number is <code>2881</code>. When you use ODP, enter the port number specified by the <code>proxy_port</code> parameter. The default port number is <code>2883</code>.</p>
   </main>

3. If **Connected** is displayed in the **Test Connection** pop-up window, the database can be connected. Then, click **Save**.

4. Double-click the database name on the **Database Navigator** tab. If the database instances appear under the database, you have connected to OceanBase Database.
