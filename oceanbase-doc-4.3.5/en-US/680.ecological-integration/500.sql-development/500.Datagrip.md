# Connect to OceanBase Database in DataGrip

DataGrip is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed by JetBrains for database management and SQL development. It can help database developers and data analysts to efficiently manage and query databases, write complex SQL queries, as well as design and maintain databases. This topic takes a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database and the macOS operating system as an example to describe how to connect to OceanBase Database in DataGrip.

## Prerequisites

* You have downloaded and installed DataGrip. For more information, see the [DataGrip official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/download/).

* The IP address of the OBServer node to be connected has access to the server where DataGrip is installed.

* You have installed OceanBase Database and created a MySQL tenant.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Obtain the OceanBase Database connection string

Contact the deployment personnel or administrator of OceanBase Database to obtain the connection string. The following is a connection string example:

```
obclient -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

**The parameters are described as follows:**

* `$host`: the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. It is the IP address of OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) for connection through ODP, or the IP address of an OBServer node for direct connection.
* `$port`: the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
* `$database_name`: the name of the database to be accessed.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>The user for connecting to a tenant must have the <code>CREATE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>DROP</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> privileges on the database. For more information about user privileges, see <a href="../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md">Privilege types in MySQL mode</a>. </p>
    </main>

* `$user_name`: the tenant account. For connection through ODP, two account formats are supported: `username@tenant name#cluster name` and `cluster name:tenant name:username`. For direct connection, the `username@tenant name` format is supported.
* `$password`: the password of the account.

For more information about the connection string, see [Connect to an OceanBase Database tenant by using OBClient](../../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/300.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-mysql-mode.md).

**Here is an example:**

```shell
obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -utest_user001@mysql001 -p****** -Dtest
```

### Step 2: Create an OceanBase data source in DataGrip

1. If you use DataGrip for the first time, start DataGrip and click **New Project** to create a project.

2. In the new project, click the <img src="https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/cloud/24v4/integrations/datagrip/database-explorer.png" width="18" align="top"> icon on the top to open the control panel of Database Explorer.

3. In the upper-left corner of Database Explorer, click the plus sign (+) and choose **Data Source** > **MySQL** > **MySQL**.

4. In the **Data Sources** dialog box, specify the following parameters based on the connection string obtained in **Step 1**.

   |Parameter|Description|
   |-----|----|
   |Name| The name of the custom data source. |
   |Host| The IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. The value is sourced from the `-h` parameter in the connection string. |
   |User| The username of the account for connecting to OceanBase Database, for example, `test`. The value is sourced from the `-u` parameter in the connection string. |
   |Password| The password of the account. The value is sourced from the `-p` parameter in the connection string. |
   |Port| The port number for connecting to OceanBase Database. The value is sourced from the `-P` parameter in the connection string. |
   |Database| The name of the database to be accessed. The value is sourced from the `-D` parameter in the connection string. |

5. Click **Test Connection**.

6. If a connection success message is displayed, click **OK**.

## What to do next

DataGrip will be ready for use after the connection is created. For more information about how to use DataGrip, see [DataGrip documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/datagrip/getting-started.html).
