# Connect to OceanBase Database in Quick BI and obtain data

This topic describes how to connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database in Quick BI Enterprise Standard Version for data display.

## Prerequisites

* You have purchased Quick BI Enterprise Standard Version. For more information about the Quick BI versions and billing methods, see [Billing Methods](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/quick-bi/product-overview/billing-methods-of-quick-bi?spm=a2c63.p38356.0.0.284b613e4Dp3lj).

* You have installed OceanBase Database and created a MySQL tenant.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Obtain the OceanBase Database connection string

Contact the deployment personnel or administrator of OceanBase Database to obtain the connection string. The following is a connection string example:

```
obclient -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

**The parameters are described as follows:**

* `$host`: the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. It is the IP address of OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) for connection through ODP, or the IP address of an OBServer node for direct connection.
* `$port`: the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
* `$database_name`: the name of the database to be accessed.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>The user for connecting to a tenant must have the <code>CREATE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>DROP</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> privileges on the database. For more information about user privileges, see <a href="../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md">Privilege types in MySQL mode</a>. </p>
    </main>

* `$user_name`: the tenant account. For connection through ODP, two account formats are supported: `username@tenant name#cluster name` and `cluster name:tenant name:username`. For direct connection, the `username@tenant name` format is supported.
* `$password`: the password of the account.

For more information about the connection string, see [Connect to an OceanBase Database tenant by using OBClient](../../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/300.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-mysql-mode.md).

**Here is an example:**

```shell
obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -utest_user001@mysql001 -p****** -Dtest
```
