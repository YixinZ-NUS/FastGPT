# Connect to OceanBase Database by using SQLAlchemy

This topic describes how to use SQLAlchemy to connect to OceanBase Database and perform basic database operations, including table creation, data insertion, data updating, and data querying.

## Prerequisites

* You have installed Python 3.x and pip.
* You have installed OceanBase Database and created a MySQL-compatible tenant.

## Procedure

1. Obtain the connection string of OceanBase Database.
2. Install the SQLAlchemy library.
3. Write a `test.py` file and enter the database connection information.
4. Run the `test.py` file.

### Step 1: Obtain the connection string of OceanBase Database

Contact the deployment personnel or administrator of OceanBase Database to obtain the corresponding database connection string.

```shell
obclient -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

**Parameters:**

* `$host`: the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), use the IP address of an ODP. For direct connection, use the IP address of an OBServer node.
* `$port`: the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
* `$database_name`: the name of the database to be accessed.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>The user used to connect to the tenant must have the <code>CREATE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> privileges on the database. For more information about user privileges, see <a href="../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md">Privilege types in MySQL mode</a>. </p>
    </main>

* `$user_name`: the tenant connection account. For connection through ODP, the format is `username@tenant name#cluster name` or `cluster name:tenant name:username`. For direct connection, the format is `username@tenant name`.
* `$password`: the account password.

For more information about connection strings, see [Connect to an OceanBase tenant by using OBClient](../../../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/300.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-mysql-mode.md).

**Here is an example:**

```shell
obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -utest_user001@mysql001 -p****** -Dtest
```

### Step 2: Install the SQLAlchemy library

SQLAlchemy is one of the most popular Object Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries in Python. It provides a SQL toolkit and an ORM system to simplify database operations. SQLAlchemy supports multiple database backends, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

Open the command prompt or PowerShell, and run the following command to install the SQLAlchemy library.

```shell
pip install sqlalchemy mysqlclient
```

After the installation is complete, run the following command to verify whether the installation was successful:

```shell
pip list | grep SQLAlchemy
```

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>SQLAlchemy is a powerful ORM library that provides two usage modes: Core and ORM. Core provides a SQL expression language, while ORM provides object-relational mapping functionality. The examples in this topic use the ORM mode.</p>
</main>

### Step 3: Write the test.py file and enter the database connection information

Write the `test.py` file based on the information obtained in **Step 1: Obtain the connection string of OceanBase Database** and enter the database connection information.

1. Create a file named `test.py`.

2. Enter the following content into the `test.py` file and modify the database connection information as needed.

   **Here is an example of the `test.py` file content:**

   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, MetaData, Table
   from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
   from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

   # Database connection information
   DB_USER = 'test_user001@mysql001'
   DB_PASSWORD = '******'
   DB_HOST = 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'
   DB_PORT = 2881
   DB_NAME = 'test'

   # Create a database connection URL
   DATABASE_URL = f"mysql+mysqldb://{DB_USER}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/{DB_NAME}"

   # Create an engine
   engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

   # Create a base class
   Base = declarative_base()

   # Define a model
   class User(Base):
       __tablename__ = 'users'

       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
       name = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
       age = Column(Integer)

       def __repr__(self):
           return f"<User(id={self.id}, name='{self.name}', age={self.age})>"

   # Create a table
   Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

   # Create a session
   Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
   session = Session()

   # Insert data
   new_users = [
       User(name='John', age=20),
       User(name='Lucy', age=25),
       User(name='Tom', age=30)
   ]
   session.add_all(new_users)
   session.commit()

   # Update data
   user = session.query(User).filter_by(name='Lucy').first()
   if user:
       user.age = 26
       session.commit()

   # Query data
   users = session.query(User).all()
   for user in users:
       print(user)

   # Close the session
   session.close()
   ```

### Step 4: Run the test.py file

Open the command prompt or PowerShell terminal, run the `test.py` file, query data, and output the result.

1. Go to the directory where the `test.py` file is located.

    **Here is an example:**

    ```shell
    cd D:\demo\demo
    ```

2. Run the `test.py` file.

    **Here is an example:**

    ```shell
    python test.py
    ```

    The return result is as follows:

    ```shell
    <User(id=1, name='John', age=20)>
    <User(id=2, name='Lucy', age=26)>
    <User(id=3, name='Tom', age=30)>
    ```

## Error handling

When using SQLAlchemy to connect to the OceanBase database, you may encounter various errors. Below are some common errors and their solutions:

1. **Connection errors**: If you are unable to connect to the database, check whether the connection parameters are correct, including the hostname, port, username, password, and database name.

2. **Permission errors**: If you encounter permission-related errors, ensure that the user has sufficient privileges to perform the required operations.

3. **SQL Syntax errors**: If there are syntax errors in your SQL statements, verify that the SQL syntax is correct.

4. **Data type errors**: If the data type of the inserted data does not match the table definition, ensure that the data type being inserted is correct.

In your code, you can use `try-except` statements to catch and handle these errors, ensuring that the program can handle errors gracefully instead of crashing. Additionally, you can use the `logging` module to record error information, which helps with debugging and troubleshooting.
