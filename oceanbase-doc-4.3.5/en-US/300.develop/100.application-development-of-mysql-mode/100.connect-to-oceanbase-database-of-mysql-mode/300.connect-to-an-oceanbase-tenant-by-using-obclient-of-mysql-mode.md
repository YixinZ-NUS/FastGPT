# Connect to an OceanBase tenant by using OBClient

This topic describes how to connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database by using OBClient.

## Prerequisites

* OBClient is downloaded and installed. If it is not downloaded, download the required version from [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter).

* The client is in the allowlist of the tenant. For more information about how to query and configure a tenant allowlist, see [View and set a tenant allowlist](../../../600.manage/200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/500.view-and-set-whitelist.md).

## Procedure

### Connect to OceanBase Database by using ODP

The following command is used to connect to OceanBase Database from OBClient by using OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP):

```shell
obclient -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p****** [-c] [-A] [$database_name]
```

**The parameters are described as follows:**

* `-h`: the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. Replace `$host` with the actual IP address. When connecting to an OceanBase cluster via ODP, use the IP address of the ODP.
* `-P`: the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. Replace `$port` with the actual port. When connecting to OceanBase Database via ODP, the default value is 2883. The port can be customized when ODP is deployed.
* `-u`: the account for connecting to OceanBase Database. Here, `$user_name` can be in any of the following formats: `username@tenant name#cluster name`, `cluster name:tenant name:username`, `cluster name-tenant name-username`, and `cluster name.tenant name.username`. The default username of the administrator of a MySQL tenant is `root`.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p><ul><li>When connecting to an OceanBase cluster via ODP, you can use the following method to obtain the cluster name: </br>First, connect directly to OceanBase Database. Then, use the <code>SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'cluster';</code> command to retrieve the name of the cluster. This command will return the name of the OceanBase cluster corresponding to the value of <code>VALUE</code>.</li><li>If ODP works for multiple clusters, you must specify the cluster name when you connect to it. If ODP works for only one cluster, you do not need to specify the cluster name when you connect to it.</li></ul></p>
   </main>

* `-p`: the password for connecting to OceanBase Database. Replace `******` with the actual password.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>For security purposes, we recommend that you do not directly enter the password on the command line, especially in an environment where the script or historical records are visible. You can skip this option and enter the password when being prompted to. </p>
   </main>

* `-c`: specifies that comments must not be ignored in the runtime environment of OBClient.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>Hint is a special comment that is not affected by the <code>-c</code> option.</p>
   </main>

* `-A`: specifies that the statistics are not automatically retrieved when you connect to a database through OBClient. This parameter is optional.
* `$database_name`: the name of the default database to be used after you connect to OceanBase Database. If not specified, you will not directly enter any database after the connection is established, and you must manually select a database after the connection is established.

**Here is an example:**

```shell
obclient -h10.10.10.1 -P2883 -uuser001@obtenant#obdemo -p****** -c -A oceanbase
```

#### Connect to OceanBase Database by using SERVICE_NAME

You can also log in to OceanBase Database by using `IP:PORT` and `SERVICE_NAME`. ODP will convert the `SERVICE_NAME` into `-uuser_name@primary tenant name#cluster of primary tenant`, so that you do not need to manually change the connection string after a primary/standby switchover. For more information about how to create a `SERVICE_NAME`, see [Create a service](../../../600.manage/200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/1700.manage-service/100.create-service.md).

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>This feature depends on OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). OCP V4.3.1 or later is required, and the OceanBase cluster must be managed by OCP for the feature to work properly. </p>
</main>

The following command is used to connect to OceanBase Database by using `SERVICE_NAME`:

```shell
obclient -h$host -P$port -u$user_name@SERVICE:$service_name -p******
```

**The parameters are described as follows:**

* `$host`: the IP address of ODP.
* `$port`: the port number of ODP.
* `$user_name`: the username.
* `$service_name`: the service name.
* `-p`: the password for connecting to OceanBase Database. Replace `******` with the actual password string.

**Here is an example:**

```sql
obclient -h10.10.10.1 -P2883 -uuser001@SERVICE:service_mysql001 -p******
```

### Connect to OceanBase Database directly

The following command is used to connect to OceanBase Database directly:

```shell
obclient -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p****** [-c] [-A] [$database_name]
```

**The parameters are described as follows:**

* `-h`: the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. Replace `$host` with the actual IP address, which is typically the IP address of an OBServer node when connecting OceanBase Database directly.

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
     <h4>Notice</h4>
     <p>When you connect to a user tenant directly, make sure that the resources of the tenant are distributed on the OBServer node you specified. Otherwise, you cannot connect to the tenant by using this OBServer node. </p>
   </main>

* `-P`: the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. Replace `$port` with the actual port. The default value is 2881 when you connect to OceanBase Database directly, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
* `-u`: the account for connecting to OceanBase Database. The format of `$user_name` is `username@tenant name`. The default username of the administrator of a MySQL tenant is `root`.

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>When you connect to OceanBase Database directly, enter the username and tenant name in the format of <code>username@tenant name</code> for the connection parameter <code>-u</code> and do not specify the cluster name. If you include the cluster name in <code>-u</code>, a connection error will occur.</p>
   </main>

* `-p`: the password for connecting to OceanBase Database. Replace `******` with the actual password string.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>For security purposes, we recommend that you do not directly enter the password on the CLI, especially in an environment where the script or historical records are visible. You can skip this option and enter the password when being prompted to. </p>
   </main>

* `-c`: specifies that comments must not be ignored in the runtime environment of OBClient. This parameter is optional.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>Hint is a special comment that is not affected by the <code>-c</code> option.</p>
   </main>

* `-A`: specifies that the statistics are not automatically retrieved when you connect to a tenant through OBClient.
* `$database_name`: the default database to use after connecting to OceanBase Database. If not specified, no database will be selected by default upon connection, and you will need to manually select a database after the connection is established. This parameter is optional.

**Here is an example:**

```shell
obclient -h10.10.10.1 -P2881 -uuser001@obtenant -p****** -c -A oceanbase
```

## Connection example

1. Open a command-line terminal.
2. Use OBClient to connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database by using ODP.

   ```shell
   obclient -hxxx.xx.xxx.xxx -P2883 -uroot@mysql001#test432 -p****** -A oceanbase
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   Welcome to the OceanBase.  Commands end with ; or \g.
   Your OceanBase connection id is 16
   Server version: OceanBase 4.3.2.0 (r200000272024061717-93c0ed73ebbcac6edbf7b585860b75d825935358) (Built Jun 17 2024 18:06:04)

   Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

   obclient [oceanbase]>
   ```

3. To exit the OBClient command line, enter `exit` and press **Enter**, or press the shortcut key **Ctrl** + **D**.
