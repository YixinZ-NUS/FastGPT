# Overview

This topic describes how to connect to and access OceanBase Database in MySQL mode. Currently, you can connect to OceanBase Database by using a client, GUI, driver, Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, or connection pool.

## Connect to OceanBase Database by using a client

You can connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database by using the following clients:

* MySQL client (mysql)

  The mysql client is a MySQL command-line interface (CLI) tool that must be separately installed. OceanBase Database supports MySQL tenants and Oracle tenants. You can use the mysql client to access a MySQL tenant.

  After you connect to OceanBase Database, you can execute MySQL O&M commands and SQL statements on the mysql command line for the following purposes:

  * Calculating, storing, and generating query results

  * Creating database objects, checking and modifying object definitions

  * Managing databases and modifying parameters

  For more information about how to connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database by using the mysql client, see [Connect to an OceanBase tenant by using the mysql client](200.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-a-mysql-client-of-mysql-mode.md).

* OceanBase Client (OBClient)

  OBClient is an interactive query tool that supports batch processing and requires separate installation. It provides a CLI and serves as a client for connecting to either a MySQL tenant or an Oracle tenant in OceanBase Database.

  Before using OBClient to connect to an OceanBase tenant, you need to provide the tenant's connection details. Once connected to OceanBase Database, OBClient allows you to execute various database commands, including standard MySQL commands as well as SQL and PL/SQL statements, for the following purposes:

  * Calculating, storing, and generating query results

  * Creating database objects, checking and modifying object definitions

  * Developing and running batch processing scripts

  * Managing databases and modifying parameters

  For more information about how to connect to an OceanBase tenant by using OBClient, see [Connect to an OceanBase tenant by using OBClient](300.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-mysql-mode.md).

* OceanBase Developer Center (ODC)

  ODC is an enterprise-level database development platform tailored for OceanBase Database.

  ODC supports connections to both MySQL and Oracle tenants within OceanBase Database. It offers a range of features for database developers, including routine development tasks, WebSQL, SQL diagnostics, session management, and data import/export capabilities.

  For more information about how to connect to an OceanBase tenant by using ODC, see [Connect to OceanBase Database by using ODC](400.connect-to-the-oceanbase-database-through-odc-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Connect to OceanBase Database by using the GUI

* DBeaver
  
  DBeaver is a general-purpose database client that connects to databases using JDBC drivers provided by various database systems. It supports a wide range of databases, including relational, non-relational, and distributed databases.

  For more information, see [Connect to OceanBase Database by using DBeaver](500.connect-to-oceanbase-database-through-dbeaver.md).

* Navicat
  
  Similar to DBeaver, Navicat is a general-purpose database client that connects to databases using JDBC drivers provided by various database systems. It also supports a wide range of databases, including relational, non-relational, and distributed databases.

  For more information, see [Connect to OceanBase Database by using Navicat](600.connect-to-oceanbase-database-through-navicat.md).

## Connect to OceanBase Database by using a driver or an ORM framework

### C driver

* C driver (OceanBase Connector/C)

  OceanBase Connector/C is a C/C++ based client development component for OceanBase Database. It supports C API libraries.

  This component allows C/C++ programs to access distributed OceanBase clusters from the underlying layer, enabling operations such as database connections, data access, error handling, and prepared statement processing.

  Also known as LibOBClient, OceanBase Connector/C is used by applications as an independent server process to communicate with OBServer nodes through network connections. During compilation, client programs reference the C API header files and connect to the C API library files.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The <code>.so</code> file generated by LibOBClient is <code>libobclient.so</code>, corresponding to the <code>libmysqlclient.so</code> file in MySQL. OceanBase Database uses OBClient as its CLI tool, equivalent to the CLI tool in MySQL. </p>
  </main>
