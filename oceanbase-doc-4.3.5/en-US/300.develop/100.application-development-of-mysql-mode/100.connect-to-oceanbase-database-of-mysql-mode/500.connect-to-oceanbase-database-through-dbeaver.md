# Connect to OceanBase Database by using DBeaver

DBeaver is a universal database client. It connects to a database through the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver provided by this database. It supports normal relational databases, non-relational databases, and distributed databases.

You can connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database by using the OceanBase or MySQL driver that comes with DBeaver. This topic describes how to connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database by using the OceanBase driver of DBeaver.

## Prerequisites

* You have downloaded and installed DBeaver. You can download the DBeaver installation package for your operating system from the [DBeaver Community](https://dbeaver.io/download/) website.

* The IP address of the OBServer node to be connected has access to the server where DBeaver is installed.

* You have installed OceanBase Database and created a MySQL tenant.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Obtain the database connection string

Contact the deployment personnel or administrator of OceanBase Database to obtain the connection string. The following is a connection string example:

```shell
obclient -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

where:

* `$host` specifies the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. It is the IP address of OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) for connection through ODP, or the IP address of an OBServer node for direct connection.
* `$port` specifies the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
* `$database_name` specifies the name of the database to be accessed.

        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>The user for connecting to a tenant must have the <code>CREATE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>DROP</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> privileges on the database. For more information about user privileges, see <a href="../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md">Privilege types in MySQL mode</a>. </p>
    </main>

* `$user_name` specifies the tenant account. Two formats are supported in the case of connection through ODP: `username@tenant name#cluster name` and `cluster name:tenant name:username`. In the case of direct connection, the format is `username@tenant name`.
* `$password` specifies the password of the account.

For more information about the connection string, see [Connect to an OceanBase Database tenant by using OBClient](300.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-mysql-mode.md).

**Here is an example:**

```shell
obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -utest_user001@mysql001 -p****** -Dtest
```

### Step 2: Connect to OceanBase Database from the DBeaver console

    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>The GUI of DBeaver varies based on the product versions. This topic describes how to connect to OceanBase Database by using DBeaver V22.0.5. For more information about the operations in other versions, see DBeaver documentation of the corresponding versions. </p>

1. (Optional) Replace the driver file.

   The default driver file for the OceanBase driver of DBeaver is `mysql-connector-java-5.1.44`. This topic takes `mysql-connector-java-5.1.47` as an example. You can replace the driver file based on the following steps.

   1. Go to the [MySQL Product Archives](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/c-j/) page on the official website of MySQL, choose version 5.1.47, and download the corresponding driver file.

   2. Choose **Database** > **Driver Manager**, search for OceanBase, select the OceanBase driver, and then click **Edit** to go to the driver editing page.

   3. Click the **Libraries** tab, select the driver file of the OceanBase driver, and then click **Delete**.

   4. Click **Add File** to add the downloaded driver file to the library and then click **OK**.

2. Choose **Database** > **New Database Connection** to go to the **Select your Database** page. You can also click the ![Connector](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer/V3.1.3/zh-CN/1.users-guide/5.database-connection-and-routing/4.administrator-guide-connect-to-oceanbase-database/4.connect-to-oceanbase-database-through-dbeaver-01.png) icon under **File** to go to the **Select your database** page.

   <!-- ![Select your database](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer/V3.1.3/zh-CN/1.users-guide/5.database-connection-and-routing/4.administrator-guide-connect-to-oceanbase-database/4.connect-to-oceanbase-database-through-dbeaver-02.png) -->

3. On the **Select your database** page, select **OceanBase** and click **Next**. On the **Connection settings** page, specify the information about the database to be connected and click **Test Connection**.

   <!-- ![Test](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer/V3.1.3/zh-CN/1.users-guide/5.database-connection-and-routing/4.administrator-guide-connect-to-oceanbase-database/4.connect-to-oceanbase-database-through-dbeaver-03.png) -->

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
       <h4>Notice</h4>
       <p>You can connect to OceanBase Database by using an IP address or ODP. When you use an IP address, enter the port number specified by the <code>mysql_port</code> parameter. The default port number is <code>2881</code>. When you use ODP, enter the port number specified by the <code>proxy_port</code> parameter. The default port number is <code>2883</code>.</p>
   </main>

4. If **Connected** is displayed in the **Test Connection** pop-up window, the database can be connected. Click **OK** and then click **Finish**.

   <!-- ![Connected](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer/V3.1.3/zh-CN/1.users-guide/5.database-connection-and-routing/4.administrator-guide-connect-to-oceanbase-database/4.connect-to-oceanbase-database-through-dbeaver-04.png) -->

5. Double-click the database name on the **Database Navigator** tab. If the database instances appear under the database, you have connected to OceanBase Database.

   <!-- ![Connection result](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer/V3.1.3/zh-CN/1.users-guide/5.database-connection-and-routing/4.administrator-guide-connect-to-oceanbase-database/4.connect-to-oceanbase-database-through-dbeaver-05.png) -->
