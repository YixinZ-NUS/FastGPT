# Core features of vector search

OceanBase Database can store, index, and search vector data. The following table describes the core features.

| **Core feature** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| Vector data types | <ul><li>Supports storage of dense float vectors with up to 16,000 dimensions.</li><li>Supports storage of sparse vector data.</li></ul> |
| Vector index | <ul><li>Supports both exact search and approximate nearest neighbor search.</li><li>Supports L2 distance, inner product, and cosine similarity calculations.</li><li>Supports HNSW/HNSW_SQ/HNSW_BQ indexes, with a maximum index column dimension of 4096. HNSW_BQ index is supported starting from version V4.3.5 BP2.</li><li>Supports IVF/IVF_SQ/IVF_PQ indexes (IVF_SQ is an experimental feature), with a maximum index column dimension of 4096.</li></ul> |
| Vector search SQL operators | Supports basic operators for vector addition, subtraction, multiplication, comparison, and aggregation. |

## Limitations and considerations

* By default, OceanBase Database uses the nullsFirst comparison mode, in which NULL values are placed first during sorting. We recommend that you add a `NOT NULL` condition in queries.
* OceanBase Database [Community Edition](../../400.deploy/500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/100.deployment-overview.md) and [Desktop Edition](../../400.deploy/500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/800.deploy-oceanbase-desktop.md) allow you to use vector search in the SYS and user tenants. OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition allows you to use vector search only in the user tenant.
