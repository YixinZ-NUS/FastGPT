# ob_hnsw_ef_search

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>This variable is available starting with OceanBase Database V4.3.3 and only applies to MySQL-compatible tenants. </p>
</main>

## Description

`ob_hnsw_ef_search` specifies the number of neighbor points to search in each layer of the graph for the HNSW algorithm during vector index queries. A larger value means the algorithm explores more neighbor points, increasing the chances of finding true nearest neighbors and improving search accuracy. However, this also increases search time.

## Privilege requirements

* Query variables

  The `sys` tenant and all user tenants can use the `SHOW VARIABLES` statement or the `information_schema.SESSION_VARIABLES` view (MySQL mode) to view the values of session system variables.

* Modify variables

  The `sys` tenant and all MySQL user tenants can directly modify the values of session system variables for their tenant.
