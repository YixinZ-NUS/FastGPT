# ob_create_table_strict_mode

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>OceanBase Database V4.x does not support independent partitions. Log streams record all change operations in the database, and you do not need to create partitions in strict mode. This variable has been deprecated since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. For more information about the relationships between log streams and partitions, see <a href="../../../100.oceanbase-database-concepts/500.distributed-database-objects/300.data-partitions-and-replicas/200.logstream.md">Log streams</a>. </p>
