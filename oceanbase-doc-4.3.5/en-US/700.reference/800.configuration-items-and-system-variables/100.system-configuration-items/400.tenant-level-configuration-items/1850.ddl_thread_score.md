# ddl_thread_score

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This parameter was introduced in OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p>
</main>

## Description

`ddl_thread_score` is used to set the number of threads used for DDL tasks.

## Privilege requirements

* Query the parameter

  The `sys` tenant and all user tenants can execute the `SHOW PARAMETERS` statement or query the `GV$OB_PARAMETERS` view to obtain the value of this parameter.

* Modify the parameter

  The `sys` tenant and user tenants can modify this parameter.

## Attributes

|      **Attribute**      |   **Description**   |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Type             | Int         |
| Default value               | 0, which means the default number of threads is 2.        |
| Value range             | [0, 100] |
| Modifiable           | Yes. You can execute the `ALTER SYSTEM SET` statement to modify this parameter.|
| Effective upon OBServer node restart| No. The parameter takes effect immediately after it is set.     |

## Considerations

* This parameter can be used to control the parallelism of DDL column drop operations as well as the parallelism during the **cross-tenant table import phase of table-level recovery**.

  * For a detailed introduction to the table-level recovery process, see [Recovery Process](../../../100.oceanbase-database-concepts/1000.high-data-reliability-and-availability/500.backup-and-recovery/400.recovery-architecture.md).

  <!-- * For information on how to use `ddl_thread_score` to control the parallelism of column drop operations, see [Optimizing the Execution Speed of Data Restructuring DDL](https://www.oceanbase.com/knowledge-base/oceanbase-database-1000000000217849?back=kb) -->

* If you find that low-priority tasks are running too slowly, you can increase the value of this parameter appropriately. It is recommended to double the value each time.

## Examples

Set the number of threads for DDL tasks under the current tenant to 4.

```shell
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET ddl_thread_score = 4;
```
