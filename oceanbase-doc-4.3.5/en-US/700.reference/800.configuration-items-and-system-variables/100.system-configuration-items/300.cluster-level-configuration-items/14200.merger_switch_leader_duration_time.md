# merger_switch_leader_duration_time

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Since V4.x no longer supports zone-level rotation-based major compactions, you no longer need to set the time interval for batch leader switching during major compactions. This parameter was removed in V4.0.0. </p>
