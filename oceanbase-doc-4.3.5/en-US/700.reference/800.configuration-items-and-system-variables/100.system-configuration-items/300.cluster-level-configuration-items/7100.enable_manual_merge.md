# enable_manual_merge

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<ul><li>OceanBase Database V4.x does not allow you to specify the order of zones in a major compaction. This parameter has been deprecated since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </li>
<li>In OceanBase Database V4.x, you can execute the <code>MAJOR FREEZE</code> statement to trigger a major compaction. The system will perform the major compaction based on the unified major compaction strategy, which means that you do not need to manually specify the order of zones in the major compaction. If an error occurs during the major compaction, you can manually control the major compaction. For more information, see <a href="../../../200.system-management/500.manage-data-storage/200.merge-management/500.manually-control-a-merge.md">Manually control a major compaction</a>. </li></ul>
</main>

## Description

`enable_manual_merge` specifies whether to enable manual major compaction.

## Attributes

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Type | Boolean |
| Default value | False |
| Value range | </li><li>True</li><li>False |
| Effective upon OBServer node restart | No |

## Considerations

If `enable_manual_merge` is set to `True`, the `alter system major freeze` statement does not trigger a major compaction. Instead, you need to manually start the major compaction for zones in the cluster one by one.
For example, you can execute the following statements to start the major compaction for `zone1` and `zone2` one by one. Also, you can change the order of zones as needed.

```sql
alter system start merge zone='zone1';
alter system start merge zone='zone2';
```
