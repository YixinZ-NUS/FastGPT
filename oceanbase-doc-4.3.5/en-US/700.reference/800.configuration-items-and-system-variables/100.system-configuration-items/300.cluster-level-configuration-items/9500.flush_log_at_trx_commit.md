## Considerations

The strategy varies with the value of the `flush_log_at_trx_commit` parameter. The parameter has the following valid values:

* `0`: The system does not wait for the logs to be written to the buffer.

* `1`: The system waits for the logs to be written to the disk.

* `2`: The system waits for the logs to be written to the buffer but does not wait for the logs to be written to the disk.
