# SERVICE_NAME

## Purpose

You can use the `ALTER SYSTEM {CREATE | DELETE | START | STOP} SERVICE ...` statement to manage `SERVICE_NAME` (service name), allowing operations such as creating, deleting, starting, and stopping the service name.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>For service name management and primary-standby switchover operations through OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), see <a href="https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-ocp-10000000001554249">Switchover</a>.</p>
</main>

## Limitations and restrictions

* The `SERVICE_NAME` feature is not supported in the `META` or `SYS` tenant.
* OCP ensures that only one primary tenant exists under a `SERVICE_NAME` in the managed clusters. You must ensure this when you manually set the `SERVICE_NAME`.
* The `FAILOVER` operation automatically deletes all `SERVICE_NAME` entries of a tenant.
* A tenant can have only one `SERVICE_NAME`.
* You cannot execute operational commands related to the `SERVICE_NAME` and tenant primary/standby roles through a connection established by using the `SERVICE_NAME`. Otherwise, the `OB_OP_NOT_ALLOW` error is returned.

## Required privileges

The user who executes the statement must have the `ALTER SYSTEM` privilege. For more information about privileges in OceanBase Database, see [Privilege types in MySQL mode](../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md) and [Privilege types in Oracle mode](../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/000.permission-classification-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM {CREATE | DELETE | START | STOP} SERVICE service_name [tenant = 'tenant_name'];
```

## Parameters

|    **Parameter**   |      **Description**      |
|---------------|--------------------|
| CREATE        | Creates a service. After a service is created, it is automatically started.|
| DELETE        | Deletes a service. Before a service is deleted, it must be stopped.|
| START         | Starts a service. After a service is started, you can establish a session or allow requests by using the `SERVICE_NAME`.|
| STOP          | Stops a service. After a service is stopped, no session is started by using the `SERVICE_NAME`, and no new session can be established by using the `SERVICE_NAME`.|
| service_name  | Specifies the service name.|
| tenant_name   | Optional. Specifies the tenant to be operated on. If this parameter is not explicitly specified, the default tenant name is the current tenant name. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>The system tenant does not support the <code>SERVICE_NAME</code> feature. Therefore, if you execute this statement in the system tenant, you must specify the <code>TENANT = tenant_name</code> clause. </p></main>|

## Examples

Create a service named `service_mysql001` for the `mysql001` tenant.

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM CREATE SERVICE service_mysql001 TENANT = 'mysql001';
```
