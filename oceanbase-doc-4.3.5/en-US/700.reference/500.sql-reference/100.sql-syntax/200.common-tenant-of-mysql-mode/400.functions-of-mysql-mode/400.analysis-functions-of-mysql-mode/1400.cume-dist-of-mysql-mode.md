# CUME_DIST

## Syntax

```sql
CUME_DIST() OVER ([query_partition_clause] order_by_clause)
```

## Purpose

This function calculates the cumulative distribution value of a row within a group (partition) and returns a value greater than `0` and less than or equal to `1`. It calculates the cumulative distribution value of a row by dividing the number of rows that are less than or equal to the current row after sorting by the total number of rows in the partition.

## Examples

1. Create a table named `employees`.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE employees(last_name CHAR(10), salary DECIMAL, job_id CHAR(32));
    ```

2. Insert test data into the `employees` table.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO employees VALUES('TOM', 11000, 'ENGINEERING');
    INSERT INTO employees VALUES('IRIS', 11000, 'ENGINEERING');
    INSERT INTO employees VALUES('MIKE', 12000, 'ENGINEERING');
    INSERT INTO employees VALUES('LILY', 13000, 'ENGINEERING');
    INSERT INTO employees VALUES('JIM', 2000, 'CLEANER');
    ```

3. Calculate the cumulative distribution value of each row in the window based on the `job_id` column and the ascending order of salary.

    ```sql
    SELECT last_name, CUME_DIST() OVER(PARTITION BY job_id ORDER BY salary) CUME_DIST FROM employees;
    ```

    The return result is as follows:

    ```shell
    +-----------+-----------+
    | last_name | CUME_DIST |
    +-----------+-----------+
    | TOM       |       0.5 |
    | IRIS      |       0.5 |
    | MIKE      |      0.75 |
    | LILY      |         1 |
    | JIM       |         1 |
    +-----------+-----------+
    5 rows in set
    ```
