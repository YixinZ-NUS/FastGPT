# Overview of array element types

OceanBase Database V4.3.3 provides the ARRAY data type, which can be used to store and process multiple elements of the same type.

OceanBase Database V4.3.3 supports the following types of array elements:

* Integer types: `TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INT`/`INTEGER`, and `BIGINT`

* Floating-point types: `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE`

* String types: `VARCHAR`

Take note of the following considerations:

* The ARRAY data type is commonly used in online analytical processing (OLAP) scenarios and is used to store and process multiple elements of the same type.

* The ARRAY data type can naturally describe entities with multi-value attributes, such as a product that belongs to multiple categories, a user with multiple tags, and a sensor with multiple measured values.

* During data analysis, you can use the ARRAY data type to verify whether a specific value is included in an array.

Take note of the following limitations:

* You cannot set a default value for a column of the ARRAY type.

OceanBase Database V4.3.3 also provides functions for the ARRAY data type. For more information, see [Overview of array functions](../../../400.functions-of-mysql-mode/950.array-functions-of-mysql-mode/100.array-functions-overview-of-mysql-mode.md).
