# NULLs

`NULL` means "no data".

`NULL` is case-insensitive. `\N` is a synonym for `NULL` and is case-sensitive. Note that a `NULL` is different from the number 0 or the empty string `''`.

When you use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort data, NULLs come before other values in ascending order and after other values in descending order.

You can use `\N` to represent `NULL` in the `LOAD DATA` and `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` statements.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient [test]> SELECT 1, NULL, \N FROM dual;
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
+------+------+------+
| 1    | NULL | NULL |
+------+------+------+
|    1 | NULL | NULL |
+------+------+------+
1 row in set
```
