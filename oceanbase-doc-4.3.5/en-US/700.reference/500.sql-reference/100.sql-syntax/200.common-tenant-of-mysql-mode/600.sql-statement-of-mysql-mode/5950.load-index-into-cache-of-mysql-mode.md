# LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE

## Purpose

This statement loads indexes into the cache to improve query performance. It allows you to load multiple indexes into the cache at a time instead of loading each index individually. This reduces system overhead during index loading and improves overall performance.

## Syntax

```sql
LOAD INDEX INTO CACHE tbl_index_list [, tbl_index_list ...];

tbl_index_list:
    tbl_name [PARTITION (partition_list)] [{INDEX|KEY} (index_name[, index_name ...])] [IGNORE LEAVES]

partition_list:
    partition_name [, partition_name ...]
    | ALL
```
