# SUBMIT JOB

## Purpose

You can use this statement to create an asynchronous job.
When you use the `INSERT INTO` or `INSERT OVERWRITE SELECT` statement to import data, the data import process is executed synchronously by default, which may fail if a large amount of data is to be imported. Therefore, in scenarios where large amounts of data are to be imported, we recommend that you submit an asynchronous import job.

## Syntax

```sql
SUBMIT JOB sql_statement ;
```

## Limitations

`sql_statement` specifies the SQL statement executed by the job. At present, only simple SQL statements are supported, such as `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`, `INSERT INTO SELECT`, `INSERT OVERWRITE`, `LOAD DATA INFILE`, and `SELECT INSERT`.

## Examples

 ```sql
obclient> SUBMIT JOB INSERT OVERWRITE test SELECT * FROM test_external_table;
+------------------------+
| job_id                 |
+------------------------+
| 2010011125899910644432 |
+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.010 sec)
```

Take note of the following items:

* The first five digits `20100` represent the database ID.
* The last several digits `11125899910644432` represent the global unique ID.
