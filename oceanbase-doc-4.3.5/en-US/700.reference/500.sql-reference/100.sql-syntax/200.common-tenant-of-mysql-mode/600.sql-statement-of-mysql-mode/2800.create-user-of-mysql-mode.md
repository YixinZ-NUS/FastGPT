# CREATE USER

## Purpose

The `CREATE USER` statement is used to create a new user in OceanBase Database. After creating a new user, you can use the new user to connect to OceanBase Database.

## Privilege requirements

To execute the `CREATE USER` statement, the current user must have the global CREATE USER privilege. For more information about OceanBase Database privileges, see [Privilege types in MySQL mode](../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md).

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS] {user [, user...]}
    [REQUIRE {NONE | SSL | X509 | tls_option}]
    [WITH resource_option [resource_option...]];

user:
      user_name
    | user_name IDENTIFIED [WITH auth_plugin] BY password
    | user_name IDENTIFIED [WITH auth_plugin] BY PASSWORD password
    | user_name IDENTIFIED [WITH auth_plugin] AS PASSWORD 'auth_string'

tls_option:
      CIPHER cipher_name
    | ISSUER issuer_name
    | SUBJECT subject_name

resource_option:
      MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR integer
    | MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS integer  
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-------|-----------|
| IF NOT EXISTS | If this option is specified, the user will not be created if the username already exists. If the username already exists and this option is not specified, an error will be returned. |
| user_name | The username. After the user is created, a new row will be added to the `mysql.user` table. You can create multiple users at a time by separating the usernames with commas (`,`). |
| auth_plugin | The authentication plugin to use for the user. Only the `mysql_native_password` plugin is supported. |
| IDENTIFIED BY password | The password for the user. The password is stored in plain text in the `mysql.user` table and will be encrypted by the server. If the password contains special characters <code>~!@#%^&*_-+=`\|(){}[]:;',.?/</code>, it must be enclosed in English quotation marks (<code>'</code> or <code>"</code>). |
| IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD password | The password for the user. The password is stored in encrypted form in the `mysql.user` table. |
| IDENTIFIED AS PASSWORD | Sets the authentication plugin to `auth_plugin` and stores the `auth_string` value in the `mysql.user` table. If the plugin requires a hashed string, it is assumed to be in the required format. |
| REQUIRE | Specifies the password verification requirements for the user. Valid values are as follows:<ul><li>NONE: Indicates that the user does not have any password verification requirements. This means the user can use any password or leave the password unset.</li><li>SSL: Indicates that the user must use an SSL connection for authentication.</li><li>X509: Indicates that the user must use an X.509 certificate for authentication.</li><li>tls_option: Indicates that the user must meet the specified TLS (Transport Layer Security) requirements.</li></ul> |
| tls_option | Specifies the specific TLS options. Valid values are as follows:<ul><li>CIPHER: Specifies the encryption algorithm or cipher suite to use for TLS connections.</li><li>ISSUER: Specifies the issuer of the TLS certificate.</li><li>SUBJECT: Specifies the subject of the TLS certificate.</li></ul> |
| resource_option | Specifies the resource options for the user. Multiple resource options can be specified, separated by spaces. Valid values are as follows:<ul><li>MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR: Specifies the maximum number of connections allowed per hour. integer is an integer that specifies the maximum number of connections allowed.</li><li>MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS: Specifies the maximum number of connections allowed per user. integer is an integer that specifies the maximum number of connections allowed.</li></ul> |

## Examples

* Create users test1 and test2, specifying plain text passwords and the maximum number of connections allowed for each user.

  ```sql
  obclient> CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS test1 IDENTIFIED BY '********', test2 IDENTIFIED BY '********' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 10;
  ```

* Create user test3, specifying an encrypted password and requiring SSL connections for authentication.

  ```sql
  obclient> CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS test3 IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '********' REQUIRE SSL;
  ```

* Create user test4, specifying the mysql_native_password authentication plugin.

  ```sql
  obclient> CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS test4 IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY PASSWORD '********';
  ```
