# Transform hints: Stmt transform hint

The statement transformation hint (stmt transform hint) allows you to control specific query transformations in SQL queries.

| Hint      | Description                               |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| `NO_REWRITE`   | Prevents any form of query rewriting.       |

## `NO_REWRITE` hint

The `NO_REWRITE` hint prevents query rewriting. After this hint is used, the query block affected by this hint will not participate in any query rewriting operations.

### Syntax

```sql
/*+ NO_REWRITE [ ( [ @ qb_name ] ) ] */
```

#### Parameters

- `@qb_name`: the name of the query block. Optional. Specifies the name of the query block to which the `NO_REWRITE` attribute is applied. If the query block name is not specified, the hint affects the entire SQL statement.

### Examples

```sql
-- The following query will not be rewritten to perform view merging because the NO_REWRITE hint is added.
SELECT /*+ NO_REWRITE */ * FROM (SELECT * FROM t1);
```

The `NO_REWRITE` hint prevents query rewriting. However, you can combine it with other query rewriting hints to allow specific types of query rewriting. For example, you can use the `MERGE` hint in the inner query block to specify view merging rewriting. Even if the outer query block has the `NO_REWRITE` hint, the view merging rewriting is forcibly performed.

```sql
-- The outer query has the NO_REWRITE hint, so automatic rewriting is not performed.
SELECT /*+ NO_REWRITE */
    *
FROM
    (SELECT /*+ MERGE */ * FROM t1) -- The inner query has the MERGE hint, which forces view merging rewriting.
WHERE
    t1.column1 = 'somevalue';
```
