# Global hints: Transform hint

Transform hints under the global hint type are used to instruct the optimizer how to handle or transform an entire query.

| Hint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION` | Prevents any query rewriting for the current query. |
| `NO_COST_BASED_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION` | Prevents cost-based query rewriting for the current query. |

## `NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION` hint

The `NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION` hint prevents any query rewriting for the current query. This hint is different from the `NO_REWRITE` hint specified for a query block. You cannot use the `NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION` hint to enable some rewriting operations that are enabled for the query block by using the `NO_REWRITE` hint.

For more information about query rewriting, see [Overview of query rewriting](../../../../../../../../1000.performance-tuning-guide/500.sql-optimization/400.sql-optimization/500.query-rewrite/100.query-rewrite-overview.md).

### Syntax

```sql
/*+ NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION */
```

### Example

```sql
-- Use the `NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION` hint to prevent any query rewriting.
SELECT /*+ NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION */ *
FROM (SELECT * FROM t1) v WHERE v.c1 = 3;
```

## `NO_COST_BASED_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION` hint

The `NO_COST_BASED_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION` hint prevents cost-based query rewriting for the current query. For more information about cost-based query rewriting, see [Introduction to cost-based rewriting](../../../../../../../../1000.performance-tuning-guide/500.sql-optimization/400.sql-optimization/500.query-rewrite/300.cost-based-query-rewriting.md).

### Syntax

```sql
/*+ NO_COST_BASED_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION */
```

### Example

```sql
-- Use the `NO_COST_BASED_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION` hint to prevent any cost-based query rewriting.
CREATE TABLE t1(c1 int, c2 int, c3 int, index idx1(c1), index idx2(c2));
SELECT /*+ NO_COST_BASED_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION */ *
FROM t1
WHERE c1 = 1 OR c2 = 1;
```
