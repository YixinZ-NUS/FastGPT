| Hint      | Description                                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `DECORRELATE`  | Enables query rewriting to decorrelate lateral tables. The reverse operation is `NO_DECORRELATE`.               |
| `NO_DECORRELATE` | Disables query rewriting to decorrelate lateral tables. The reverse operation is `DECORRELATE`.           |

## `DECORRELATE` hint

The `DECORRELATE` hint enables query rewriting to decorrelate lateral tables in a query. Decorrelating converts correlated subqueries that depend on the external query into independent or uncorrelated queries.

The reverse operation of the `DECORRELATE` hint is the `NO_DECORRELATE` hint, which disables query rewriting to decorrelate lateral tables.

### Syntax

```sql
/*+ DECORRELATE [ ( [ @ qb_name ] ) ] */
```

#### Parameters

- `@qb_name`: optional. The name of the query block to which the decorrelation rewrite is applied.

### Examples

The following example shows how to use the `DECORRELATE` hint to enable query rewriting to decorrelate lateral tables in a query.

```sql
-- The `NO_MERGE` hint and `DECORRELATE` hint are used together to ensure that the subquery is not merged with the outer query and explicitly request the optimizer to decorrelate the subquery.
SELECT *
FROM t1, LATERAL (SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE DECORRELATE */ *
                  FROM t2
                  WHERE t2.c2 = t1.c1) v
WHERE v.c1 = 1;
```

## `NO_DECORRELATE` hint

The `NO_DECORRELATE` hint is the reverse operation of the `DECORRELATE` hint. It disables query rewriting to decorrelate lateral tables.

### Syntax

```sql
/*+ NO_DECORRELATE [ ( [ @ qb_name ] ) ] */
```

#### Parameters

- `@qb_name`: optional. The name of the query block for which the decorrelation rewrite is disabled.

### Examples

The following example shows how to use the `NO_DECORRELATE` hint to disable query rewriting to decorrelate lateral tables.

```sql
-- The `NO_MERGE` hint and `NO_DECORRELATE` hint are used together to ensure that the optimizer does not merge the subquery into the outer query and does not perform decorrelation.
SELECT *
FROM t1, LATERAL (SELECT /*+ NO_MERGE NO_DECORRELATE */ *
                  FROM t2
                  WHERE t2.c2 = t1.c1) v
WHERE v.c1 = 1;
```
