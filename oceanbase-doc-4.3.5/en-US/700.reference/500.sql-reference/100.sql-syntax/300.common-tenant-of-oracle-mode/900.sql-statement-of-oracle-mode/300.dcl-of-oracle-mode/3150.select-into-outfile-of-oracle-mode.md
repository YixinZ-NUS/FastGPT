# SELECT INTO

## Purpose

You can use this statement to store query results in a variable, a file, or a table. Here are the details:

* `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` stores the result set in an external file, and you can specify the output format.

* `SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE` writes an unformatted single line to an external file.

* `SELECT ... INTO var_list` stores the result set in variables.

## Privilege requirements

To execute the `SELECT INTO` statement, you must have the `SELECT` privilege on the table. For more information about OceanBase Database privileges, see [Privilege types in the Oracle-compatible mode](../../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/000.permission-classification-of-oracle-mode.md).

### file_name

The `file_name` parameter is in the following format:

* When you export a file to an OBServer node, use the format of `\$PATH/\$FILENAME`. The parameters are described as follows:

  * `\$PATH`: specifies the path to save the exported file, which is the path of the exported file on the OBServer node.
  * `\$FILENAME`: the name of the file to be exported. When `SINGLE = FALSE`, it specifies the prefix of the exported file. If you do not specify the `\$FILENAME` parameter, the system sets the prefix of the exported file to the default value `data`. The system automatically generates the file extension based on the export type.

* When you export a file to OSS, the save path is in the format of `oss://\$PATH/\$FILENAME/?host=\$HOST&access_id=\$ACCESS_ID&access_key=\$ACCESSKEY`. The parameters are described as follows:

  * `\$PATH`: the path to save the exported file, which specifies the file path in the bucket.
  * `\$FILENAME`: the name of the file to be exported. When `SINGLE = FALSE`, it specifies the prefix of the exported file. If you do not specify the name, the system uses the default prefix `data`. The system automatically generates the suffix.
  * `\$HOST`: specifies the endpoint of the OSS service or the CDN domain name for accelerated access to the OSS service.
  * `\$ACCESS_ID`: specifies the Access Key ID required for accessing OSS service, which is used for authentication.
  * `\$ACCESSKEY`: specifies the AccessKey Secret required for accessing the OSS service.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p><ul><li>For OceanBase Database V4.3.5, <code>SELECT INTO</code> can be used to export data to objects stored on S3 and objects stored on services that comply with the S3 protocol, starting from V4.3.5 BP2. </li><li>Alibaba Cloud's Object Storage Service (OSS) has a file size limit. If you want to export a file larger than 5 GB to OSS, the file will be split into multiple files, each smaller than 5 GB.
  </main>

### field_term

* `[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY string`: specifies the characters that enclose field values. By default, values are not enclosed. For example, `ENCLOSED BY '"'` indicates that character values are enclosed in double quotation marks. If the `OPTIONALLY` keyword is used, the specified characters are used to enclose only string values.
* `TERMINATED BY string`: specifies the symbol that separates field values. For example, `TERMINATED BY ','` uses a comma to separate two field values.
* `ESCAPED BY string`: specifies the escape character to process special characters or parse data in a special format. The default escape character is the backslash (`\`).

### line_term

* `STARTING BY string`: specifies the starting character of each row.
* `TERMINATED BY string`: specifies the ending character of each line. By default, a line is terminated by a line break. For example, `... LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' ...` indicates that each line is terminated by a line break.

### file_option

* `SINGLE [=] {TRUE | FALSE}`: specifies whether to export data to a single file or multiple files.

  * `SINGLE [=] TRUE`: specifies to export data to a single file. This is the default value.
  * `SINGLE [=] FALSE`: specifies to export data to multiple files.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>When the degree of parallelism is greater than 1 and <code>SINGLE = FALSE</code>, data can be exported to multiple files to achieve parallel read and write and improve the export speed. </p>
    </main>

* `MAX_FILE_SIZE [=] {int | string}`: specifies the maximum size of a single file when data is exported to multiple files. This parameter is effective only when `SINGLE = FALSE`.

* `BUFFER_SIZE [=] {int | string}`: specifies the size of memory that is separately applied for each partition by each thread when data is exported. The value of this parameter represents the size of memory applied for a single partition when data is exported without partitioning. The default value is 1 MB.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p><ul><li><code>BUFFER_SIZE</code> is used for export performance tuning. If sufficient physical memory is available and high export efficiency is desired, you can set this parameter to a large value (for example, 4 MB). If insufficient physical memory is available, you can set this parameter to a small value (for example, 4 KB). If you set this parameter to 0, all partitions of a single thread share a public memory. </li><li>Starting from OceanBase Database V4.3.2 BP1, the <code>BUFFER_SIZE</code> parameter is supported. </li></ul></p>
  </main>

### external_file_format_list

* When **TYPE = 'CSV'**, the file contains the following columns:

  * `LINE_DELIMITER`: specifies the line delimiter of the CSV file. The default value is `'\n'`.
  * `FIELD_DELIMITER`: specifies the field delimiter of the CSV file. The default value is `'\t'`.
  * `ESCAPE`: specifies the escape character of the CSV file. It must be 1 byte in length. The default value is `'\'`.
  * `FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY`: specifies the characters that enclose the field values of the CSV file. This parameter is optional. The default value is an empty string. This option allows you to add enclosing characters only to specific types of fields, such as CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT, and JSON.
  * `FIELD_ENCLOSED_BY`: specifies the characters that enclose the field values of the CSV file. This parameter is optional. The default value is an empty string, which specifies not to add enclosing characters. This option adds enclosing characters to all types of fields.
  * `ENCODING`: specifies the character set encoding format of the file. If this parameter is not specified, the default value `UTF8MB4` takes effect.
  * `COMPRESSION`: specifies the compression format of the file. This parameter is optional. The supported compression formats are NONE, GZIP, DEFLATE, and ZSTD.
    * `GZIP`/`DEFLATE`: specifies that the file is a GZIP-compressed file.
    * `ZSTD`: specifies that the file is a ZSTD-compressed file.
    * `NONE`: specifies that the file is not compressed. This is the default value.
  * `FILE_EXTENSION`: specifies the user-defined file extension. This parameter is required only when multiple files are exported. It is supported only for CSV files. If this parameter is not specified, the file extension is determined by the file format. The default file extension for CSV files is `.csv`.

* When **TYPE = 'PARQUET'**, the following fields are included:

  * `COMPRESSION`: specifies the compression format of the PARQUET file. The default value is `.parquet`. The supported compression formats are `UNCOMPRESSED` (which specifies that the file is not compressed), `SNAPPY`, `GZIP`, `BROTLI`, `ZSTD`, `LZ4`, and `LZ4_HADOOP`. If this parameter is not specified, the default value `UNCOMPRESSED` takes effect.
  * `ROW_GROUP_SIZE`: specifies the size of the ROW GROUP in the PARQUET file. The unit is bytes. You can specify a numeric value or a string with a suffix of `B`, `K`, `M`, or `G` to indicate bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes respectively. The default value is `256MB`. We recommend that you use the default value.

* When **TYPE = 'ORC'**, it contains the following fields:

  * `COMPRESSION`: specifies the compression format of the ORC file. The default value is `.orc`. The supported compression formats are `UNCOMPRESSED` (which specifies that the file is not compressed), `SNAPPY`, `ZLIB`, `LZ4`, and `ZSTD`. If this parameter is not specified, the default value `UNCOMPRESSED` takes effect.
  * `COMPRESSION_BLOCK_SIZE`: specifies the size of the block into which the data is compressed. The unit is bytes. You can specify a numeric value or a string with a suffix of `B`, `K`, `M`, or `G` to indicate bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes respectively. The default value is `256KB`. We recommend that you use the default value.
  * `STRIPE_SIZE`: specifies the size of a Stripe in the ORC file. The unit is bytes. You can specify a numeric value or a string with a suffix of `B`, `K`, `M`, or `G` to indicate bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes respectively. The default value is `64MB`. We recommend that you use the default value.
  * `ROW_INDEX_STRIDE`: specifies the frequency of index records. It defines the number of rows between two consecutive index records. If this parameter is not specified, the default value `10000` takes effect. We recommend that you use the default value.

## Examples

### Export data to a local file

1. Set the export file path.

    To export a file, you must set the system variable `secure_file_priv` to a path that allows access to the export file.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>For security reasons, when you set the system variable <code>secure_file_priv</code>, you can only connect to the database using a local Unix socket to execute the SQL statement that modifies the global variable. For more information, see <a href="../../../../../800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/200.system-variable/300.global-system-variable/12000.secure_file_priv-global.md">secure_file_priv</a>.</p>
    </main>

    1. Log in to the OBServer node where you want to connect to OceanBase Database.

        ```bash
        ssh admin@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
        ```

    2. Connect to the `oracle001` tenant using the local Unix socket.

        ```bash
        obclient -S /home/admin/oceanbase/run/sql.sock -usys@oracle001 -p******
        ```

    3. Set the export path to `/home/admin/test_data`.

        ```sql
        obclient> SET GLOBAL secure_file_priv = "/home/admin/test_data";
        ```

    4. Log out.

2. Reconnect to the database, and then use the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` statement to export data. Use commas to separate values in different fields; wrap string values with `"` characters; and use line breaks as the end marker.

   * Export data to a single file in serial mode. Specify the file name as `test_tbl1.csv`.

     ```sql
     obclient> SELECT /*+parallel(2)*/ *
     INTO OUTFILE '/home/admin/test_data/test_tbl1.csv'
       FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
       LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
     FROM test_tbl1;
     ```

     The return result is as follows:

     ```shell
     Query OK, 9 rows affected
     ```

   * Write data to multiple files in parallel. Do not specify the file name, and ensure that the size of each file does not exceed 4 MB.

     ```sql
     obclient> SELECT /*+parallel(2)*/ *
       INTO OUTFILE '/home/admin/test_data/'
       FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
       LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
       SINGLE = FALSE MAX_FILE_SIZE = '4MB'
     FROM test_tbl1;
     ```

     The return result is as follows:

     ```shell
     Query OK, 9 rows affected
     ```

   * Write data to multiple files in parallel. Specify the file name prefix as `dd2024`, and ensure that the size of each file does not exceed 4 MB.

     ```sql
     obclient> SELECT /*+parallel(2)*/ *
       INTO OUTFILE '/home/admin/test_data/dd2024'
       FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
       LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
       SINGLE = FALSE MAX_FILE_SIZE = '4MB'
     FROM test_tbl1;
     ```

     The return result is as follows:

     ```shell
     Query OK, 9 rows affected
     ```

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p><ul><li>When multiple export tasks export to the same path simultaneously, issues such as errors or partial data export may occur. You can avoid this by properly setting the export paths. </br>For example:</br><code>SELECT /*+parallel(2)*/ * INTO OUTFILE 'test/data' SINGLE = FALSE FROM t1;</code> and <code>SELECT /*+parallel(2)*/ * INTO OUTFILE 'test/data' SINGLE = FALSE FROM t2;</code> executed simultaneously may fail due to identical export file names. It is recommended to set separate export paths, such as <code>test/data1</code> and <code>test/data2</code>.</li><li>When <code>SINGLE = FALSE</code>, and the export fails due to reasons such as "file already exists," you can clear all files in the export directory with the same prefix as the export target or delete and recreate the export directory before retrying the export operation.</br>For example:</br><code>SELECT /*+parallel(2)*/ * INTO OUTFILE 'test/data' SINGLE = FALSE FROM t1;</code> fails, you can delete all files with the <code>data</code> prefix in the <code>test</code> directory or directly delete and recreate the <code>test</code> directory, then retry the export operation.</li></ul></p>
    </main>

3. Log in to the server and view the exported files in the `/home/admin/test_data` directory on the OBServer node.

  ```shell
  [xxx@xxx /home/admin/test_data]# ls
  ```

  The return result is as follows:

  ```shell
  data_0_0_0  data_0_1_0  dd2024_0_0_0  dd2024_0_1_0  test_tbl1.csv
  ```

  In this example, `test_tbl1.csv` is the file name when data is exported to a single file in serial mode; `data_0_0_0` and `data_0_1_0` are the file names when data is written to multiple files in parallel without specifying the file name; `dd2024_0_0_0` and `dd2024_0_1_0` are the file names when data is written to multiple files in parallel with the file name prefix set to `dd2024`.

### Export data to OSS

You can execute the `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` statement to export data from the `test_tbl2` table to a specified OSS storage location based on the partitions. The partitions are determined by the combination of the `col1` and `col2` columns. Rows with the same values in these two columns are grouped into the same partition and exported to the same directory.

```sql
obclient> SELECT /*+parallel(3)*/ *
  INTO OUTFILE 'oss://$DATA_FOLDER_NAME/?host=$OSS_HOST&access_id=$OSS_ACCESS_ID&access_key=$OSS_ACCESS_KEY'
    PARTITION BY CONCAT(col1,'/',col2)
    SINGLE = FALSE BUFFER_SIZE = '2MB'
FROM test_tbl2;
```

The storage location is specified by the `$DATA_FOLDER_NAME` variable. You also need to provide the host address, access ID, and access key of the OSS.
