# GRANT

## Purpose

This statement allows a system administrator to grant privileges to users, including object privileges, system privileges, and roles.

## Privilege requirements

To execute the `GRANT` statement, the current user must have the privileges to be granted and the privileges to grant the specified privileges. For example, to grant the `SELECT` privilege on table `tbl1` to user `user2` by using user `user1`, user `user1` must have the `SELECT` privilege on table `tbl1` and the privilege to grant the `SELECT` privilege on table `tbl1` to other users.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>After you grant privileges to a user, the user must reconnect to OceanBase Database for the privileges to take effect. </p>
</main>

## Syntax

```sql
/* Grant object privileges. */
GRANT {obj_all_col_priv [, obj_all_col_priv...]}
    ON obj_clause
    TO {grant_user [, grant_user...]}
    [WITH GRANT OPTION]

/* Grant system privileges or roles. */
GRANT obj_all_col_priv [, obj_all_col_priv...]
    TO grantee_clause
    [WITH ADMIN OPTION]

grantee_clause:
      grant_user [, grant_user...]
    | grant_user IDENTIFIED BY password

obj_all_col_priv:
      role
    | sys_and_obj_priv [(column_list)]
    | ALL [PRIVILEGES] [(column_list)]

obj_clause:
    schema_name.relation_name
    | CATALOG external_catalog_name
```

## Parameters

|        Parameter         |                                         Description                                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| obj_all_col_priv | The privileges to be granted. You can grant privileges or roles to users directly or indirectly, and grant multiple privileges to a user at the same time by separating the privilege types with commas (`,`). For more information about the privilege types, see [Privilege types in Oracle mode](../../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/000.permission-classification-of-oracle-mode.md).         |
| obj_clause | The authorization object. Valid values: <ul><li>`schema_name.relation_name` </li><li>`CATALOG external_catalog_name`</li></ul>|
| grant_user | The user or role to which privileges are granted. Valid values: <ul><li>`user [USER_VARIABLE]`: specifies to grant privileges to a specific user.</li><li>`CONNECT`: specifies to grant privileges to the CONNECT role.</li><li>`RESOURCE`: specifies to grant privileges to the RESOURCE role.</li><li>`PUBLIC`: specifies to grant privileges to the public role.</li></ul>|
| IDENTIFIED BY password | The password of the user to which privileges are to be granted. In this example, the password is specified in plaintext. After the password is stored in the `dba_users` table, the server encrypts it. If the password contains special characters <code>~!@#%^&*_-+=`\|(){}[]:;',.?/</code>, enclose it in double quotation marks ( <code>""</code> ).  |
| WITH GRANT OPTION | Specifies whether to allow the granted privilege to be granted again. If you revoke a privilege that is granted with this clause, the privilege granted again based on this privilege is also revoked.                                                                 |
| WITH ADMIN OPTION | Specifies whether to allow the granted role to be granted again. If you revoke a role that is granted with this clause, the role granted again based on this role is not revoked.                                                                |
| role | The role to be granted. Valid values: <ul><li>`role_name`: the name of a custom role.</li><li>`DBA`: the database administrator role that has full database administration privileges. A user to which the DBA role is granted can perform any database operation.</li><li>`RESOURCE`: the RESOURCE role.</li><li>`CONNECT`: the CONNECT role.</li><li>`PUBLIC`: the public role.</li></ul> |

## Examples

* Grant the `CREATE VIEW` privilege to the `user1` user and allow this privilege to be granted to other users.

  ```shell
  obclient> GRANT CREATE VIEW TO user1 WITH ADMIN OPTION;
  ```

* Grant the `CONNECT` role to the `user1` user and change the password of the `user1` user.

  ```shell
  obclient> GRANT CONNECT TO user1 IDENTIFIED by '********';
  ```

  After the operation is performed, check the password of the `user1` user in the `dba_users` table. The password has been updated to the newly set one.

* Grant the COMMENT ANY TABLE privilege to the `role1` role.

  ```shell
  GRANT COMMENT ANY TABLE TO role1;
  ```

* Grant the `USE CATALOG` privilege on the `test_odps_catalog` object in the catalog to the `user004` user.

  ```sql
  GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG test_odps_catalog TO user004;
  ```

* Grant the `CREATE CATALOG` and `USE ANY CATALOG` system privileges to the `user005` user.

  ```sql
  GRANT CREATE CATALOG, USE ANY CATALOG TO user005;
  ```
