# DROP CONCURRENT_LIMITING_RULE

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This statement is available starting from OceanBase Database V4.3.5 BP3. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

This statement is used to delete a throttling rule.

## Limitations and considerations

To execute the `DROP CONCURRENT_LIMITING_RULE` statement in OceanBase Database in Oracle mode, you must have the `drop any concurrent_limiting_rule` privilege.

## Syntax

```sql
DROP CONCURRENT_LIMITING_RULE [ IF EXISTS ] "ccl_rule_name1" [, "ccl_rule_name2", ...]
```

Here, `ccl_rule_name` specifies the name of the throttling rule.

## Examples

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>When a throttling rule is deleted, all SQL statements in the waiting queue of the rule are executed normally. </p>
</main>

Execute the following statement to delete the throttling rules `sql1_keywords_ccl_rule` and `sql2_keywords_ccl_rule`:

```shell
obclient> DROP CONCURRENT_LIMITING_RULE "sql1_keywords_ccl_rule", "sql2_keywords_ccl_rule";
```
