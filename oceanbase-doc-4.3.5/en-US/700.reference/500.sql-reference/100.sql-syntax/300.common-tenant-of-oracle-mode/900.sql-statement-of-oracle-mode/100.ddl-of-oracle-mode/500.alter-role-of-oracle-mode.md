# ALTER ROLE

## Purpose

  </main>

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER ROLE role_name
{ NOT IDENTIFIED
| IDENTIFIED BY password
} ;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter    | Description     |
|-----------|------------|
| `role_name`            | The name of the role to be modified. It can be a STRING_VALUE, NAME_OB, or a predefined role name (DBA, RESOURCE, CONNECT, and PUBLIC). |
| `NOT IDENTIFIED`       | Specifies that no authentication method is used when the role is enabled.  |

## Examples

* Create a role named `role1` and modify its authentication method to password-based. The password is `password1`.

  ```sql
  obclient> CREATE ROLE role1;

  obclient> ALTER ROLE role1 IDENTIFIED BY password1;
  ```

* Change the password of the `role1` role to `password2`.

  ```sql
  obclient> ALTER ROLE role1 IDENTIFIED BY password2;
  ```

* Enable the `role1` role without any authentication method.

  ```sql
  obclient> ALTER ROLE role1 NOT IDENTIFIED;
  ```
