# DDL statements

This topic describes the requirements and suggestions on writing DDL statements in OceanBase Database.

- We recommend that you use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement to delete all data of a table.

- We recommend that you perform online DDL operations during off-peak hours to reduce the impact on the system.

* In OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V3.x, the degree of parallelism (DOP) of DDL operations must be lower than 40.
