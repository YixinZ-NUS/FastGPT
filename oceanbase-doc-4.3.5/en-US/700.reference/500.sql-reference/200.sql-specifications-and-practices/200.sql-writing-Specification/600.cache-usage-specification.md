# Cache

This topic describes the requirements and suggestions on the use of caches in OceanBase Database.

* If a field is frequently written by an application, such as a counter, we recommend that you make use of the write cache.

* Use a hint to control the plan cache.

  * The hint `/*+ USE_PLAN_CACHE(NONE)*/` specifies not to use the plan cache.

  * The hint `/*+USE_PLAN_CACHE(DEFAULT)*/` specifies to use the plan cache.

* Do not use hints, such as `FORCE INDEX`, `IGNORE INDEX`, `STRAIGHT_JOIN`, and `SQL_NO_CACHE`, for SQL statements.
