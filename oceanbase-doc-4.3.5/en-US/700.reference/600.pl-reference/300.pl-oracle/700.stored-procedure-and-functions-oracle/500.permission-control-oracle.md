# Privilege control

By default, functions and stored procedures can be executed by their creators only. However, the creators can use the `GRANT` statement to authorize other users to execute the functions and stored procedures.

The syntax of `GRANT` is as follows:

```javascript
GRANT system_privilege | role  
TO user | role | PUBLIC [WITH ADMIN OPTION]

GRANT object_privilege | ALL ON schema.object  
TO user | role | PUBLIC [WITH GRANT OPTION]
```



Example: Grant all users the privilege to execute the `hr.log_message` stored procedure.

```javascript
obclient> GRANT EXECUTE ON log_message TO PUBLIC;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```



These are frequently used system privileges:

* `CREATE ANY PROCEDURE`: the privilege to create any stored procedures.



* `DROP ANY PROCEDURE`: the privilege to drop any stored procedures.



* `EXECUTE ANY PROCEDURE`: the privilege to execute any stored procedures.
