## Syntax

```sql
UTL_SMTP.MAIL (
   c           IN OUT NOCOPY   connection,
   sender      IN              VARCHAR2,
   parameters  IN              VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL)
RETURN reply;

UTL_SMTP.MAIL (
   c           IN OUT NOCOPY   connection,
   sender      IN              VARCHAR2,
   parameters  IN              VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL);
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** |         **Description**         |
|--------|------------------------|
|c|The SMTP connection. |
|sender|The sender's email address. |
|parameters|The format of the SMTP protocol as defined in RFC1869. It must follow the format "XXX=XXX (XXX=XXX ....)".|

## Return value

| **Return value** |          **Description**          |
|---------|--------------------------|
|reply|The reply to the command. If multiple replies are returned, the last reply is returned. |

## Considerations

The `mail` command is used to inform the server that a new mail transaction has been initiated. This transaction must be completed with subsequent `rcpt` and `data` commands. The connection to the SMTP server must remain open, and the `helo` or `ehlo` command must have already been executed.
