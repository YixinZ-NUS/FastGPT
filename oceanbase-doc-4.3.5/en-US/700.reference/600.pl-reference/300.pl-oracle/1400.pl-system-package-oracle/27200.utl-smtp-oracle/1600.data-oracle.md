# DATA

`DATA` is used to specify the email body.

<main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This content applies only to the Oracle-compatible mode of OceanBase Database. </p>
</main>

## Syntax

```sql
UTL_SMTP.DATA (
   c     IN OUT NOCOPY connection
   body  IN  VARCHAR2 CHARACTER SET ANY_CS)
RETURN reply;

UTL_SMTP.DATA (
   c     IN OUT NOCOPY connection
   body  IN VARCHAR2 CHARACTER SET ANY_CS);
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** |         **Description**         |
|--------|------------------------|
|c|The SMTP connection.|
|body|The text information to be sent, which includes headers and is in the [RFC822] format. |

## Return value

| **Return value** |          **Description**          |
|---------|--------------------------|
|reply|The reply to the command. If multiple replies are received, the last reply is returned. |

## Considerations

* The application must ensure that the content of the `body` parameter complies with the `MIME (RFC822)` standard. Use `<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>` as the message terminator. Any `<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>` in the text content will be escaped as `<CR><LF>..<CR><LF>`. This must be called after `RCPT`.
* The expected response is a message starting with `250`. The initial return code `354` from the `DATA` command will not be returned.

   * `354` indicates that the client has sent the `DATA` command to the SMTP server and has started transmitting the email body. If the server is ready to receive data, it will return the `354` status code.

   * `250` indicates that the request has been successfully received and processed.
