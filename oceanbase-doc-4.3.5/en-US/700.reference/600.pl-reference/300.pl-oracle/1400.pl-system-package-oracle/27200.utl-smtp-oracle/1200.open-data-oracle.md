# OPEN_DATA

`OPEN_DATA` is used to send the `data` command, informing the server that the email content is about to be sent. The email content is subsequently written using `write_data` and `write_raw_data`.

```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** |         **Description**         |
|--------|------------------------|
|c|The SMTP connection. |

## Return values

| **Return value** |          **Description**          |

|reply|The reply to the command. If multiple replies are received, the last reply is returned. |

## Considerations

* `OPEN_DATA`, `WRITE_DATA`, `WRITE_RAW_DATA`, and `CLOSE_DATA` must be called in strict sequence. `OPEN_DATA` sends the `data` command to indicate the start of email content transmission. Multiple calls to `WRITE_DATA` and `WRITE_RAW_DATA` can then be made to send the email body, and finally, `CLOSE_DATA` sends the terminator to end the transmission.
* Must be called after `RCPT`.
* The expected response is a message starting with `250` or `251`, indicating that the SMTP server has successfully responded and accepted the specified email content.
