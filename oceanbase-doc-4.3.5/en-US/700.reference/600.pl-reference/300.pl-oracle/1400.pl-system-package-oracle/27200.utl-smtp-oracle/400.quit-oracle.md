## Return value

|reply|The response to the command. If multiple responses are received, the last response is returned. |

## Considerations

* You can send the `QUIT` command to the server to terminate the session and then disconnect from the server. The `QUIT` command must be called after the `open_connection` call.
* If the `QUIT` command is issued during a mail transaction, it is equivalent to canceling the transaction using the `REST` method.
* The expected response is a message that starts with `221`, indicating that the SMTP server has processed the request and disconnected.
