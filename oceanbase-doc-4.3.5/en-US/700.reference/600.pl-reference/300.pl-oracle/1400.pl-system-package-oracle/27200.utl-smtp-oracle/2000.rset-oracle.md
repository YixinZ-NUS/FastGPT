## Considerations

* The `REST` command allows canceling the email being composed without sending it. It can be used between `open_connection` and `data` or `open_data` to cancel the email transaction. However, once the email starts being sent, it cannot be stopped.
* The expected response is a message starting with `250`, indicating that the current email transaction has been terminated.
