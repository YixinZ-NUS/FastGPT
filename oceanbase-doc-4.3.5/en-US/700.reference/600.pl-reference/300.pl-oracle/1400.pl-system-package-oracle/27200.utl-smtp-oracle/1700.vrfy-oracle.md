|--------|------------------------|
|c|The SMTP connection. |
|recipient|The email address to be verified. |

## Return value

|reply|The reply to the command. If multiple replies are returned, the last reply is returned. |

## Considerations

* The server will attempt to resolve the email address to be verified. If successful, it will return the recipient's full name and the fully qualified mailbox path.
* Must be called after `open_connection` and either `helo` or `ehlo`.
* The expected response is a message starting with `250` or `251`.
  * `250`: This code is returned when the SMTP server successfully processes the VRFY (verify) request and confirms that the queried email address is valid. This indicates that the email address exists and can receive emails.
  * `251`: This code may be returned if the email address being verified does not belong to the local system, but the server knows how to forward it to the correct destination.
