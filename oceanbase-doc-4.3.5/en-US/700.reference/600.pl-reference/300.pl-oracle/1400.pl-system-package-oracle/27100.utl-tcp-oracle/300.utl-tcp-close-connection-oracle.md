# CLOSE_CONNECTION

`CLOSE_CONNECTION` is used to close an open TCP/IP connection.

<main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This content applies only to the Oracle-compatible mode of OceanBase Database. </p>
  </main>

## Syntax

```sql
UTL_TCP.CLOSE_CONNECTION (
   c IN OUT NOCOPY connection);
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** |         **Description**         |
|--------|------------------------|
|c|The TCP/IP connection to be closed. |

## Considerations

* The connection to be closed must have been opened using `open_connection`. After the connection is closed, the fields `remote_host`, `remote_port`, `local_host`, `local_port`, `charset`, and `private_sd` will be reset.
* Connections must be explicitly closed. The connection will not be automatically closed when the `connection` variable goes out of its lifecycle.
* Any connections that remain open will be automatically closed when the session is terminated.
