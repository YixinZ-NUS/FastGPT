# WRITE_RAW

`WRITE_RAW` is used to write binary data to a service connected through an open connection.

<main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This content applies only to the Oracle-compatible mode of OceanBase Database. </p>
</main>

## Syntax

```sql
UTL_TCP.WRITE_RAW (
   c    IN OUT NOCOPY connection,
   data IN            RAW,
   len  IN            PLS_INTEGER DEFAULT NULL)
 RETURN PLS_INTEGER;
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** |         **Description**         |
|--------|------------------------|
|c| The TCP/IP connection. |
|data| A buffer that contains the data to be sent. |
|len| The number of bytes to be transmitted. If it is `NULL`, all the data is transmitted. |

## Return value

The actual number of bytes transmitted.

## Considerations

* The connection must have been previously opened using `open_connection`.
* If `len` is greater than the number of characters in `data`, an `bad argument` exception is thrown.
