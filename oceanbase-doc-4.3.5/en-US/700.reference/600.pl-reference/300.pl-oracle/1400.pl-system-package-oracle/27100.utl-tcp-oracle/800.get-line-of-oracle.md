# GET_LINE

`GET_LINE` is used to return the text line data that is read. It continues to read until the end of the line or the end of the input stream is reached.

<main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This content applies only to the Oracle-compatible mode of OceanBase Database. </p>

## Syntax

```sql
UTL_TCP.GET_LINE (
   c           IN OUT NOCOPY connection,
   remove_crlf IN            BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
   peek        IN            BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE)
 RETURN VARCHAR2;
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** |         **Description**         |
|--------|------------------------|
|c| The TCP/IP connection. |
|remove_crlf|If set to `true`, any `CRLF` line breaks at the end of the line are removed. |
|peek|If set to `true`, the data is inspected but not removed from the input queue (input buffer must exist).|

## Return value

The return value is the content of the read text line.

## Considerations

* The connection must have been previously opened using `open_connection`.
* This function only returns when it has read until the end of the line or the end of the input.
* The message text is converted from the online character set specified at the time of opening the connection to the database character set before being returned.
* If a transfer timeout was set when opening the connection, this function will continue waiting to read packets until the timeout occurs. It will stop reading and return all successfully read data. If no data is successfully read, a `transfer_timeout` exception will be raised.
