```sql
UTL_TCP.WRITE_LINE (

   data IN            VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL CHARACTER SET ANY_CS)
  RETURN PLS_INTEGER;
```

## Parameters

|--------|------------------------|
|c| A TCP/IP connection.|
|data|A buffer that contains the data to be sent. |

* Before transmission, the text character set is converted to the specified online character set.
