# WRITE_TEXT

`WRITE_TEXT` is used to send a text message to the service connected through an open connection.

<main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This content applies only to the Oracle-compatible mode of OceanBase Database. </p>
</main>

## Syntax

```sql
UTL_TCP.WRITE_TEXT (
   c    IN OUT NOCOPY connection,
   data IN            VARCHAR2 CHARACTER SET ANY_CS,
   len  IN            PLS_INTEGER DEFAULT NULL)
 RETURN PLS_INTEGER;
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** |         **Description**         |
|--------|------------------------|
|c| A TCP/IP connection. |
|data|A buffer that contains the data to be sent. |
|len|The number of characters of data to be transmitted. If it is `NULL`, all data is transmitted. The actual amount of data written may be less than the specified amount due to network conditions. |

## Return value

The actual number of characters of data transmitted.

## Considerations

* The connection must have been previously opened using `open_connection`.
* Before transmission, the text character set is converted to the specified online character set.
* If `len` is greater than the number of characters in `data`, an `bad argument` exception is thrown.
