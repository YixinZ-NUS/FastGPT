# Overview

Partition splitting is the process of dividing a partition into two or more new partitions based on specified rules. This process is typically applied to large tables in a database to prevent excessive data accumulation in a single partition, thereby improving data management and query performance.

## Types of partition splitting

OceanBase Database in MySQL mode supports the following types of partition splitting:

* Manual partition splitting
* Automatic partition splitting

### Manual partition splitting

Manual partition splitting involves splitting partitions in an existing partitioned table. OceanBase Database supports manual execution of partition splitting commands using MySQL-compatible syntax, enabling you to divide an existing partition into multiple partitions.

For more information, see [Manual partition splitting](200.manual-partition-splitting-of-mysql-mode.md).

### Automatic partition splitting

Automatic partition splitting is performed by the system based on preconfigured automatic partitioning rules (including the `SIZE` clause and automatic partitioning parameters). In OceanBase Database, you can define these rules in advance, allowing the system to automatically split partitions when the data volume reaches a specified threshold. This ensures that database tables can expand dynamically as data grows, preventing performance issues and load imbalances caused by oversized partitions.
