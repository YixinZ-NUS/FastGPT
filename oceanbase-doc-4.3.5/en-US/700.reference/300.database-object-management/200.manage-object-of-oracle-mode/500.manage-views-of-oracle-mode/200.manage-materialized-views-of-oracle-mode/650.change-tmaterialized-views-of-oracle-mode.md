# Modify the attributes of a materialized view

This topic describes how to execute an SQL statement to modify the attributes of a materialized view.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>In OceanBase Database V4.3.5, the feature to modify the attributes of materialized views is supported starting from V4.3.5 BP1. </p>
</main>

## Privileges

To modify a materialized view, the current user must have the `ALTER` privilege on the target object. For more information about privileges in OceanBase Database, see [Privilege types in Oracle mode](../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/000.permission-classification-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Syntax

The syntax for modifying a materialized view is as follows:

```sql
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW [schema.]view_name alter_mview_action_list;

alter_mview_action_list:
    alter_mview_action [, alter_mview_action ...]

alter_mview_action:
    parallel_clause
    | REFRESH [nested_refresh_option] [[START WITH expr] [NEXT expr]]

parallel_clause:
    NOPARALLEL
    | PARALLEL integer

nested_refresh_option:
    INDIVIDUAL
    | INCONSISTENT
    | CONSISTENT
```

## Parameters

* `schema.`: optional. The schema where the materialized view resides. If you specify `schema.`, you must specify the schema name. If you omit `schema.`, the default schema in the current session is used.
* `view_name`: the name of the materialized view to be modified.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>For OceanBase Database V4.3.5, the <code>RENAME</code> statement can be used to rename materialized views starting from V4.3.5 BP3. </p>
    </main>

* `alter_mview_action_list`: the list of actions that can be performed on the materialized view. Multiple actions can be specified at once, separated by commas (`,`).

For more information about the parameters, see [ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW](../../../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/100.ddl-of-oracle-mode/250.alter-materialized-view-of-oracle-mode-in-sql.md).

## Examples

1. Create a table named `test_tbl1`.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE test_tbl1 (col1 NUMBER PRIMARY KEY, col2 VARCHAR2(20), col3 NUMBER, col4 BLOB);
    ```

2. Create a materialized view named `mv_test_tbl1`.

    ```sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_test_tbl1
        AS SELECT col1, col2, col3
           FROM test_tbl1;
    ```

3. Set the degree of parallelism of the `mv_test_tbl1` materialized view to 5.

    ```sql
    ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_test_tbl1 PARALLEL 5;
    ```

4. Set the refresh schedule of the `mv_test_tbl1` materialized view so that the initial refresh time is the current date and the materialized view is refreshed every day thereafter.

    ```sql
    ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_test_tbl1
        REFRESH START WITH current_date NEXT current_date + 1;
    ```

5. Create a nested materialized view named `mv_mv_test_tbl1` based on the materialized view `mv_test_tbl1`, with the refresh strategy set to `INDIVIDUAL`.

    ```sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_mv_test_tbl1
        REFRESH COMPLETE INDIVIDUAL
        AS SELECT col1, col2
           FROM mv_test_tbl1;
    ```

6. Change the refresh strategy of the nested materialized view `mv_mv_test_tbl1` to `INCONSISTENT`.

    ```sql
    ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_mv_test_tbl1
        REFRESH INCONSISTENT;
    ```
