# Overview

Partition splitting is the process of splitting one partition into two or more partitions based on specific rules. This process is usually performed on large tables in a database to avoid data overflow in a single partition, which improves data management and query performance.

## Types of partition splitting

OceanBase Database in Oracle mode supports the following types of partition splitting:

* Manual partition splitting
* Automatic partition splitting

### Manual partition splitting

Manual partition splitting is the process of splitting an existing partition on a partitioned table. OceanBase Database supports the execution of the manual partition splitting command by using compatible commands with Oracle Database to split an existing partition into multiple partitions.

For more information, see [Manual partition splitting](200.manual-partition-splitting-of-oracle-mode.md).

### Automatic partition splitting

Automatic partition splitting is the process of splitting partitions based on automatically generated partitioning rules (including the `SIZE` clause and automatic partitioning parameters). In OceanBase Database, you can set automatic partitioning rules in advance. When the data volume reaches a certain level, the system automatically splits partitions based on the rules, allowing the database table to automatically scale as the data volume grows, thus avoiding performance issues caused by data overflow in a single partition.

For more information, see [Automatic partition splitting](300.automatic-partition-splitting-of-oracle-mode.md).
