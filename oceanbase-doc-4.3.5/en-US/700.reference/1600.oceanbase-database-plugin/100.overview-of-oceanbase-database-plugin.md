## How to develop and use plugins

OceanBase Database allows you to develop plugins using C/C++ and provides a complete plugin development kit (PDK). If your development environment includes the C/C++ development toolchain and the OceanBase PDK is configured, you can quickly get started with plugin development.

## Supported scenarios

The plugin mechanism of OceanBase Database currently supports the following scenarios:

* Tokenizer plugins: These plugins expand the full-text search capabilities of the database, allowing users to customize tokenization logic to meet diverse text processing requirements.
