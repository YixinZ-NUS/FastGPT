# oceanbase.DBA_WR_SQLSTAT

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<ul><li>In V4.3.x, this view was introduced in V4.3.5. </li> <li>In V4.2.x, this view was introduced in V4.2.2. </li></ul>
</main>

## Purpose

The `DBA_WR_SQLSTAT` view displays the basic performance statistics of SQL statements executed in the tenant, with each SQL statement represented by a row (that is, each unique value of `SQL_ID` and `Plan_Hash` represents a row). The statistics with `_DELTA` in the column name indicate the incremental statistics from the last WR snapshot to the current time.
