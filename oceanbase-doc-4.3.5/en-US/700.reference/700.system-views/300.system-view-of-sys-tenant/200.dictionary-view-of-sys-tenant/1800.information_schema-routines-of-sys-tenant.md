## Columns

| Column | Type | Nullable? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SPECIFIC_NAME | varchar(64) | NO | The name of the routine.  |
| ROUTINE_CATALOG | varchar(512) | NO | The name of the catalog to which the routine belongs. At present, this column is not used, and the current value is def.  |
| ROUTINE_SCHEMA | varchar(64) | NO | The name of the schema to which the routine belongs.  |
| ROUTINE_NAME | varchar(64) | NO | The name of the routine. The value is the same as that of `SPECIFIC_NAME`.  |
| ROUTINE_TYPE | varchar(9) | NO | The type of the routine. Valid values:<ul><li>   `PROCEDURE`: indicates a stored procedure. </li><li>  `FUNCTION`: indicates a stored function.</li></ul> |
| DATA_TYPE | varchar(64) | NO | The data type of the return value of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, this column is empty. At present, this column is not used.  |
| CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH | bigint(20) | NO | The maximum character length for string return values of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this column is `NULL`. At present, this column is not used.  |
| CHARACTER_OCTET_LENGTH | bigint(20) | NO | The maximum byte length for string return values of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, this value is `NULL`. At present, this column is not used.  |
| NUMERIC_PRECISION | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The numeric precision for numeric return values of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this column is `NULL`. At present, this column is not used.  |
| NUMERIC_SCALE | bigint(20) | NO | The numeric scale for numeric return values of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this column is `NULL`. At present, this column is not used.  |
| DATETIME_PRECISION | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The fractional seconds precision for temporal return values of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this column is `NULL`. At present, this column is not used.  |
| CHARACTER_SET_NAME | varchar(64) | NO | The character set name for string return values of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this column is `NULL`. At present, this column is not used. |
| COLLATION_NAME | varchar(64) | NO | The collation name for string return values of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this column is `NULL`. At present, this column is not used.  |
| DTD_IDENTIFIER | longtext | NO | Reserved for future use. The data type of the return value of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, this column is empty. The value of `DATA_TYPE` contains only the type name, without other information. The value of `DTD_IDENTIFIER` contains the type name and possibly other information such as the precision or length.  |
| ROUTINE_BODY | varchar(8) | NO | The language used for the routine definition. The value is always `SQL`.  |
| ROUTINE_DEFINITION | longtext | NO | The text of the routine definition.  |
| EXTERNAL_NAME | varchar(64) | NO | The value of this column is always `NULL`.  |
| EXTERNAL_LANGUAGE | varchar(64) | NO | The language of the routine. At present, this column is not used.  |
| PARAMETER_STYLE | varchar(8) | NO | The value of this column is always `SQL`.  |
| IS_DETERMINISTIC | varchar(3) | NO | Indicates whether the stored procedure is defined with the `DETERMINISTIC` characteristic (YES) or not (NO). At present, this column is not used.  |
| SQL_DATA_ACCESS | varchar(64) | NO | Reserved for future use. The data access characteristic for the routine.  |
| SQL_PATH | varchar(64) | NO | The value of this column is always `NULL`. |
| SECURITY_TYPE | varchar(7) | NO | The SQL security type. Valid values:<ul><li>   DEFINER </li><li>   INVOKER (At present, this column is not used.) </li></ul> |
| CREATED | datetime | YES | The date and time when the routine was created.  |
| LAST_ALTERED | datetime | YES | The date and time when the routine was last modified. If the routine has not been modified since its creation, the value of this column is the same as the value of `CREATED`.  |
| SQL_MODE | text | NO | The SQL mode in effect when the routine was created or modified and under which the routine executes.  |
| ROUTINE_COMMENT | longtext | NO | The text of the comment. |
| DEFINER | varchar(93) | NO | The account named in the `DEFINER` sub-clause (often the user who created the routine).  |
| CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT | varchar(32) | NO | The session value of the system variable `CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT` when the routine was created or modified.  |
| COLLATION_CONNECTION | varchar(32) | NO | The session value of the system variable `COLLATION_CONNECTION` when the routine was created or modified.  |
| DATABASE_COLLATION | varchar(32) | NO | The session value of the system variable `DATABASE_COLLATION` when the routine was created or modified.  |

## Sample query
