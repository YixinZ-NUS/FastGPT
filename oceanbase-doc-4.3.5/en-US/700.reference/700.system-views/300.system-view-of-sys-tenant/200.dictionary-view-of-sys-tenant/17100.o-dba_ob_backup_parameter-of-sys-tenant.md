# oceanbase.DBA_OB_BACKUP_PARAMETER

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>This view was introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

This view displays the backup parameter information configured for the current tenant. Since the system tenant does not contain user data and is used for cluster management, it does not support backup and recovery. Therefore, the `sys` tenant does not have backup parameters configured. For the `sys` tenant, the query result of this view is always empty.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Nullable? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NAME | varchar(1024) | NO | The name of the parameter. |
| VALUE | longtext | NO | The value of the parameter. |
