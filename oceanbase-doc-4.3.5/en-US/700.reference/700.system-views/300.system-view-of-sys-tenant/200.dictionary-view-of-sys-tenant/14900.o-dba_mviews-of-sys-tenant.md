Valid values:<ul><li>`FRESH`: The materialized view is a read-consistent view of its masters in the current state.</li><li>`IMPORT`: The materialized view is imported from another database. In this case, the value of the `UNKNOWN_IMPORT` column is `Y`. Therefore, it is unknown whether the materialized view is a read-consistent view of its masters at any point in time. After a complete refresh, the `STALENESS` value of the view changes to `FRESH`. </li><li>`NEEDS_COMPILE`: Some objects on which the materialized view depends have changed. In this case, you must execute the `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW...COMPILE` statement to verify this materialized view and calculate the staleness of its data. </li><li>`STALE`: The materialized view is stale because one or more of its masters have changed. If the `STALENESS` value of the materialized view changes from `FRESH` to `STALE`, the materialized view is a read-consistent view of its masters in an earlier state. </li><li>`UNDEFINED`: The materialized view has remote masters. The concept of staleness is not defined for this type of materialized views. </li><li>`UNKNOWN`: It is unknown whether the materialized view is a read-consistent view of its masters at any point in time.</li><li>`UNUSABLE`: The materialized view is not a read-consistent view of its masters at any point in time.</li></ul><main id="notice" type='explain'> <h4>Note</h4><p>This column is used only for compatibility and its value is `NULL` by default. </p></main> |

It can also be modified later using the <code>ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW</code> syntax. If the user does not explicitly set <code>PARALLEL</code> (and <code>REFRESH_DOP</code> remains at its default value of 0), the background refresh parallelism will depend on the value of the global system variable `mview_refresh_dop`.</li><li>This column was introduced starting from V4.3.5 BP1 in OceanBase Database V4.3.5.</li></ul></p></main>|
