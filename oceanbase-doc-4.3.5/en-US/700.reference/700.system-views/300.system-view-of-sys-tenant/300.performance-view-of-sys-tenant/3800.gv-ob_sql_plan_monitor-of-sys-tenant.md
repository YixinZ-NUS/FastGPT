# GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced in OceanBase Database V1.4. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR` view displays statistics at the operation level for slow queries on all OBServer nodes in all tenants. For each slow query, statistics are provided for each operation, including the time consumed by the operator and the number of rows returned.

The value of the `OTHERSTAT_X_ID` field can be queried from the [V$SQL_MONITOR_STATNAME](35900.v-sql_monitor_statname-of-sys-tenant.md) view.

## Sample query

The following example queries the statistics of slow queries at the operation level on all OBServer nodes in all tenants.

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR limit  1\G
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
