# GV$OB_FLT_TRACE_CONFIG

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view was introduced in OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

This view displays diagnostic information about full-link tracing.

## Columns

| **Column** | **Type** | **Nullable?** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TENANT_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The tenant ID. <ul><li>1: the ID of the system tenant. </li><li>Other values: the ID of a user tenant or a Meta tenant. </li></ul> |
| TYPE | varchar(16) | NO | The monitoring level of the diagnostic information. <ul><li>Tenant level: diagnostic information is monitored at the tenant level. </li><li>module/action level: diagnostic information is monitored at the module and action levels. </li><li>client_identifier level: diagnostic information is monitored at the client identifier level. </li></ul> |
| TENANT_NAME | varchar(128) | NO | The name of the tenant. |
| MODULE_NAME | varchar(4096) | NO | The name of the module. |
| ACTION_NAME | varchar(4096) | NO | The name of the action. |
| CLIENT_IDENTIFIER | varchar(65) | NO | The name of the client identifier. |
| LEVEL | bigint(20) | NO | The full-link tracing monitoring level of the session. For example, 1 indicates that the diagnostic information of level 1 is monitored. |
| SAMPLE_PERCENTAGE | bigint(20) | NO | The full-link tracing sampling frequency of the session. For example, 50 indicates that the diagnostic information is sampled with a 50% probability. |
| RECORD_POLICY | varchar(32) | NO | The full-link tracing recording strategy of the session. The following three strategies are supported:<ul><li>ALL: Trace points of all diagnostic information that are traced by sampling are printed to the log file. For this strategy, the Trace logs are printed to the log file when each span ends. </li><li>ONLY_SLOW_QUERY: Trace points of all diagnostic information that are traced by sampling are printed to the log file only if the request is a slow query. For this strategy, the Trace logs are printed to the log file only after the request is determined to be a slow query. In a proxy, for a root span, which is a transaction-level span, the Trace logs are printed to the log file when a slow query is detected. </li><li>SAMPLE_AND_SLOW_QUERY: Trace points of all diagnostic information that are traced by sampling are printed to the log file if they meet the following conditions:<ol><li>When the <code>_print_sample_ppm</code> hidden parameter is used for sampling with a probability of 1 per ten thousand, the trace points are printed to the log file only if the sampling result is selected. </li><li>The trace points meet the conditions for printing in the ONLY_SLOW_QUERY mode. </li></ol> In this mode, the Trace logs are not printed to the log file when each span ends. If condition 1 is met, the trace points are marked as forced to be printed to the log file and are passed to the subsequent link components. If condition 2 is met, the Trace logs are printed to the log file when the request ends and is determined to be a slow query. </li></ul> |
