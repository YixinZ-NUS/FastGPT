| JOB_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The job ID of the backup task. |
| INCARNATION | NUMBER(38) | NO | The nth incarnation of the database after the Flashback Database operation. |
| BACKUP_SET_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the backup set corresponding to the backup task. |
| START_TIMESTAMP | VARCHAR2(256) | NO | The start time of the backup task. |
| END_TIMESTAMP | VARCHAR2(256) | NO | The end time of the backup task. |
| STATUS | VARCHAR2(4096) | NO | The backup status. |

| USER_LS_START_SCN | NUMBER(38)  | NO | The SCN of the metadata of the backup log stream. |
| ENCRYPTION_MODE | VARCHAR2(4096) | YES | The encryption mode.
