## Sample query

Query all index subpartitions in the database.

```shell
obclient [SYS]> SELECT INDEX_OWNER, INDEX_NAME, PARTITION_NAME, SUBPARTITION_NAME, HIGH_VALUE, PARTITION_POSITION, SUBPARTITION_POSITION FROM DBA_IND_SUBPARTITIONS;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+-------------+----------------+----------------+-------------------+------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
| INDEX_OWNER | INDEX_NAME     | PARTITION_NAME | SUBPARTITION_NAME | HIGH_VALUE | PARTITION_POSITION | SUBPARTITION_POSITION |
