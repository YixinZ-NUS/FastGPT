## Sample query

Query the information of the `TBL1` table in the tables accessible to the current user.

```shell
obclient [SYS]> SELECT OWNER, TABLE_NAME, STATUS, PCT_FREE, TEMPORARY, NESTED, ROW_MOVEMENT, DROPPED, EXTERNAL FROM SYS.ALL_TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'TBL1';
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+-------+------------+--------+----------+-----------+--------+--------------+---------+----------+
| OWNER | TABLE_NAME | STATUS | PCT_FREE | TEMPORARY | NESTED | ROW_MOVEMENT | DROPPED | EXTERNAL |
+-------+------------+--------+----------+-----------+--------+--------------+---------+----------+
| SYS   | TBL1       | VALID  |        0 | N         | NO     | NO           | NO      | NO       |
+-------+------------+--------+----------+-----------+--------+--------------+---------+----------+
1 row in set
```
