## Sample query

Query information from the `T_SUBPART` table.

```shell
obclient [SYS]> SELECT OWNER, TABLE_NAME, STATUS, PCT_FREE, NUM_ROWS, PARTITIONED, TEMPORARY, ROW_MOVEMENT, DROPPED, EXTERNAL FROM SYS.DBA_ALL_TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME='T_SUBPART';
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+-------+------------+--------+----------+----------+-------------+-----------+--------------+---------+----------+
| OWNER | TABLE_NAME | STATUS | PCT_FREE | NUM_ROWS | PARTITIONED | TEMPORARY | ROW_MOVEMENT | DROPPED | EXTERNAL |
+-------+------------+--------+----------+----------+-------------+-----------+--------------+---------+----------+
| SYS   | T_SUBPART  | VALID  |        0 |     1000 | YES         | N         | NO           | NO      | NO       |
