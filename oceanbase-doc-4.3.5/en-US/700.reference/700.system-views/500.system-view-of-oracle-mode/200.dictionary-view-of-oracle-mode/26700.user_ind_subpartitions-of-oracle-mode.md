## Sample query

Query the information about index subpartitions (subpartitions) in the databases owned by the current user.

```shell
obclient [SYS]> SELECT INDEX_NAME, PARTITION_NAME, SUBPARTITION_NAME, HIGH_VALUE, PARTITION_POSITION, SUBPARTITION_POSITION FROM USER_IND_SUBPARTITIONS;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+----------------+----------------+-------------------+------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
| INDEX_NAME     | PARTITION_NAME | SUBPARTITION_NAME | HIGH_VALUE | PARTITION_POSITION | SUBPARTITION_POSITION |
+----------------+----------------+-------------------+------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
