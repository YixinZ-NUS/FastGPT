## Sample query

The following example queries information about all constraints on tables owned by the user.

```shell
obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.USER_CONSTRAINTS\G
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
*************************** 1. row ***************************
            OWNER: SYS
  CONSTRAINT_NAME: TBL2_OBUNIQUE_1722234886020510
  CONSTRAINT_TYPE: U
       TABLE_NAME: TBL2
 SEARCH_CONDITION: NULL
          R_OWNER: NULL
R_CONSTRAINT_NAME: NULL
      DELETE_RULE: NULL
           STATUS: ENABLED
       DEFERRABLE: NOT DEFERRABLE
         DEFERRED: IMMEDIATE
        VALIDATED: VALIDATED
        GENERATED: GENERATED NAME
              BAD: NULL
             RELY: NULL
      LAST_CHANGE: NULL
      INDEX_OWNER: SYS
       INDEX_NAME: TBL2_OBUNIQUE_1722234886020510
          INVALID: NULL
     VIEW_RELATED: NULL
