## Sample query

Query the information of the `TBL2_F_RL` table in the database.

```shell
obclient [SYS]> SELECT OWNER, TABLE_NAME, STATUS, PCT_FREE, TEMPORARY, NESTED, ROW_MOVEMENT, DROPPED, EXTERNAL FROM SYS.DBA_TABLES WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'TBL2_F_RL';
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+-------+------------+--------+----------+-----------+--------+--------------+---------+----------+
| OWNER | TABLE_NAME | STATUS | PCT_FREE | TEMPORARY | NESTED | ROW_MOVEMENT | DROPPED | EXTERNAL |
+-------+------------+--------+----------+-----------+--------+--------------+---------+----------+
| SYS   | TBL2_F_RL  | VALID  |        0 | N         | NO     | NO           | NO      | NO       |
+-------+------------+--------+----------+-----------+--------+--------------+---------+----------+
1 row in set
