| INCARNATION | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of times the Flashback Database has been incarnated. |
| DEST_NO | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of log_archive_dest_n. For example, the dest_no of log_archive_dest is 0, and that of log_archive_dest_1 is 1. |
| STATUS | VARCHAR2(64) | NO | The status of the piece:<li>ACTIVE: the piece is currently active.<li>FREEZING: the piece is being frozen.<li>FROZEN: the piece has been frozen. The status of the piece cannot be changed after it is frozen. |
| START_SCN | NUMBER(38) | NO | The starting SCN of the piece. |
