## Purpose

The `GV$OB_SESS_TIME_MODEL` view displays the time model statistics for sessions in the cluster.

## Columns

| **Column** | **Type**  | **Nullable?** | **Description**                               |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| SID        | NUMBER       | NO   | Session ID     |
| TENANT_ID  | NUMBER       | NO   | Tenant ID     |
| SVR_IP     | VARCHAR2(46) | NO   | Node IP       |
| SVR_PORT   | NUMBER(38)   | NO   | Node port        |
| STAT_ID    | NUMBER       | NO   | Stat ID         |
| STAT_NAME  | VARCHAR2(64) | NO   | Stat name       |
| VALUE      | NUMBER       | NO   | Stat value        |

The following table describes the statistics events and their IDs in the `STAT_NAME` column.

| Statistics event | Description | Stat ID | Stat type |
| ------------|------|------------|----------------|
| DB time                                |  The total time of database activities, which is the sum of CPU time and non-idle wait time.  |  200001 |  3072 |
| DB CPU                                 |  The CPU time of database activities.                    |  200002 |  3072 |
| background elapsed time                |  The total time of background processes.                           |  200005 |  3072 |
| background cpu time                    |  The CPU time of background processes.                        |  200006 |  3072 |
| non idle wait time                     |  The total time of non-idle waits, which is the total time when the session is in a waiting state but not in an idle wait state.  |  200010 |  3072 |
| idle wait time                         |  The total time of idle waits, which is the total time when the session is in an idle wait state.    |  200011 |  3072 |
| background database time               |  The total time of database operations performed by background processes.                   |  200012 |  3072 |
| background database non-idle wait time |  The total time of database operations performed by background processes in non-idle wait states.    |  200013 |  3072 |
| background database idle wait time     |  The total time of database operations performed by background processes in idle wait states.      |  200014 |  3072 |
| concurrency wait total time            |  The total wait time due to concurrency issues, such as wait time due to resource locking. | 220001 |  3072 |
| user io wait total time                |  The total wait time of user processes waiting for I/O operations (such as data reads or writes to disk) to complete. | 220002 |  3072 |
| application wait total time            |  The total wait time generated by user application code (such as lock waits caused by row-level locking or explicit lock commands).| 2200013 |  3072 |

## Sample query

```shell
obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.GV$OB_SESS_TIME_MODEL WHERE ROWNUM = 1;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+---------------+-----------+----------------+----------+---------+--------------------+-------+
| SID           | TENANT_ID | SVR_IP         | SVR_PORT | STAT_ID | STAT_NAME          | VALUE |
+---------------+-----------+----------------+----------+---------+--------------------+-------+
| 4947802324992 |      1004 | 172.xx.xxx.xxx |     2882 |  200010 | non idle wait time |     0 |
+---------------+-----------+----------------+----------+---------+--------------------+-------+
1 row in set
```
