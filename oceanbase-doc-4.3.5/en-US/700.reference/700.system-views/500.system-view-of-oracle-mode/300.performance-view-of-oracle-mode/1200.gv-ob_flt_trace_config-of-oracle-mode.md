# GV$OB_FLT_TRACE_CONFIG

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view was introduced in OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

This view displays the diagnostic information for full-chain tracing.

## Columns

| **Column** | **Type** | **Nullable?** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TENANT_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the tenant. <li>Other values: the ID of a user tenant or a meta tenant. </li></ul> |
| TYPE | VARCHAR2(16) | NO | The monitoring level of the diagnostic information.  </li><li>module/action level: diagnostic information is monitored at the module and action levels. </li><li>client_identifier level: diagnostic information is monitored at the client identifier level. </li></ul> |
| TENANT_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The name of the tenant. |
| MODULE_NAME | VARCHAR2(4096) | NO | The name of the module. |
| ACTION_NAME | VARCHAR2(4096) | NO | The name of the action. |
| CLIENT_IDENTIFIER | VARCHAR2(65) | NO | The name of the client identifier. |
| LEVEL | NUMBER(38) | NO | The full-chain tracing monitoring level of the session. For example, 1 indicates that the diagnostic information with a level of 1 is traced. |
| SAMPLE_PERCENTAGE | NUMBER(38) | NO | The full-chain tracing sampling frequency of the session. For example, 50 indicates that the diagnostic information is sampled with a probability of 50%. |
| RECORD_POLICY | VARCHAR2(32) | NO | The full-chain tracing recording strategy of the session. It supports three strategies:<ul><li>ALL: Trace points of all traces that are sampled and traced are printed to the log file. The traces are printed to the log file when each span ends. </li><li>ONLY_SLOW_QUERY: Only request traces that are traced when the requests are sampled and traced and are judged to be slow queries are printed to the log file. Other traces are discarded. For this printing strategy, the trace logs are printed to the log file after the requests are judged to be slow queries. In the proxy, the root span, which is the transaction-level span, is printed to the log file when a slow query is detected. </li><li>SAMPLE_AND_SLOW_QUERY: All traces that are sampled and traced meet one of the following conditions are printed to the log file:<ol><li>When the sampling probability is 0.1% and the sampling result is selected, the trace is printed to the log file. </li><li>The trace meets the printing condition of the ONLY_SLOW_QUERY mode. </li></ol> In this mode, the trace logs are not printed to the log file when each span ends. If condition 1 is met, the trace logs are marked as forced to be printed and are passed to the next link component. If condition 2 is met, the trace logs are printed to the log file when the requests are judged to be slow queries. </li></ul> |
