| TRANS_STATE | varchar(32) | YES        | The transaction status. <ul><li>`IDLE`: The transaction is idle. This indicates that the transaction has not started. </li> <li>`ACTIVE`: The transaction is explicitly opened. This indicates that the transaction is opened by using the `START TRANSACTION` or `BEGIN` statement. </li> <li>`IMPLICIT_ACTIVE`: The transaction is implicitly opened. In the `autocommit = on` mode, the transaction is implicitly opened after a DML statement that modifies data is executed. </li> <li>`ROLLBACK_SAVEPOINT`: The transaction is rolled back to a savepoint. </li> <li>`IN_TERMINATE`: The transaction is being terminated. This indicates that the transaction is terminated due to internal reasons or terminated by the user. For example, the `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` statement is executed. </li> <li>`ABORTED`: The transaction is terminated due to an exception. </li> <li>`ROLLED_BACK`: The transaction is rolled back. </li> <li>`COMMIT_TIMEOUT`: The transaction submission times out. </li> <li>`COMMIT_UNKNOWN`: The result of the transaction submission is unknown. </li> <li>`COMMITTED`: The transaction is successfully committed. </li></ul> |

| MODULE      | varchar(4096) | YES        | The name of the current operation set by calling the DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_MODULE procedure. |
| CLIENT_INFO | varchar(4096) | YES        | The information set by calling the DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_CLIENT_INFO procedure. |
| LEVEL       | bigint(20) | NO         | The full-link tracing monitoring level of the session. For example, 1 indicates that the diagnostic information of level 1 is available. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This field was introduced in V4.2.1. </p></main> |
| SAMPLE_PERCENTAGE | bigint(20) | NO         | The full-link tracing sampling frequency of the session. For example, 50 indicates that the diagnostic information is sampled at a 50% frequency. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This field was introduced in V4.2.1. </p></main> |
| RECORD_POLICY     | varchar(32)      | NO         | The full-link tracing recording strategy of the session. The following three strategies are supported:<ul><li>ALL: Trace points of all traces that are sampled and opened are printed to the log file. The traces are printed to the log file when each span is ended. </li><li>ONLY_SLOW_QUERY: Only traces of slow queries that are sampled and opened are printed to the log file. Other traces are discarded. For this printing strategy, the trace logs are printed to the log file after a request is determined to be a slow query. In obproxy, for a root span, which is a transaction-level span, the root span is printed to the log file when a slow query is detected. </li><li>SAMPLE_AND_SLOW_QUERY: All traces that are sampled and opened are printed to the log file if they meet the following conditions:<ol><li>When the <code>_print_sample_ppm</code> hidden parameter is used for sampling with a probability of 1/1000, the trace is printed to the log file only if the sampling result is selected. </li><li>The trace meets the printing conditions of the ONLY_SLOW_QUERY mode. </li></ol> In this mode, the trace logs are not printed to the log file when a span is ended. If condition 1 is met, the trace logs are marked as mandatory to be printed and are passed to the following link components. If condition 2 is met, the trace logs are printed to the log file at the same time as in the ONLY_SLOW_QUERY mode. </li></ul><main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This field was introduced in V4.2.1. </p></main> |

## Sample query

Query the session information of all OBServer nodes where the tenant is located.

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_PROCESSLIST LIMIT 1\G
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
