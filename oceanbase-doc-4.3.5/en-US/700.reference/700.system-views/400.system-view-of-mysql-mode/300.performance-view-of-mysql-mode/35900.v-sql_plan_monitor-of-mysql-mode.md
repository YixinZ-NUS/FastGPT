# V$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view was introduced in OceanBase Database V1.4. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `V$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR` view displays statistics at the operation level of slow queries on the current OBServer node in the tenant. Each operation has one statistic.

The value of the `OTHERSTAT_X_ID` field can be queried from the [V$SQL_MONITOR_STATNAME](35800.v-sql_monitor_statname-of-mysql-mode.md) view.

## Sample query

Query the statistics of slow queries at the operation level on the current OBServer node in the current tenant.

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.V$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR limit  1\G
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
