# GV$OB_FLT_TRACE_CONFIG

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view was introduced in OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

This view displays diagnostic information about full-link trace.

## Columns

| **Column** | **Type** | **Nullable?** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TENANT_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the tenant. </li><li>Other values: the ID of a user tenant or a meta tenant. </li></ul> |
| TYPE | varchar(16) | NO | The monitoring level of the diagnostic information.  </li><li>module/action level: the diagnostic information is monitored at the module and action levels. </li><li>client_identifier level: the diagnostic information is monitored at the client identifier level. </li></ul> |
| TENANT_NAME | varchar(128) | NO | The name of the tenant. |
| MODULE_NAME | varchar(4096) | NO | The name of the module. |
| ACTION_NAME | varchar(4096) | NO | The name of the action. |
| CLIENT_IDENTIFIER | varchar(65) | NO | The name of the client identifier. |
| LEVEL | bigint(20) | NO | The full-link trace monitoring level of the session. For example, 1 indicates that the diagnostic information with level 1 is traced. |
| SAMPLE_PERCENTAGE | bigint(20) | NO | The full-link trace sampling frequency of the session. For example, 50 indicates that the diagnostic information is sampled with a probability of 50%. |
| RECORD_POLICY | varchar(32) | NO | The full-link trace recording strategy of the session. The following three strategies are supported:<ul><li>ALL: trace points of all diagnostic information that are traced by full-link trace and whose sampling is enabled are printed to the log file. The trace points are printed to the log file when each span ends. </li><li>ONLY_SLOW_QUERY: trace points of all diagnostic information that are traced by full-link trace and whose sampling is enabled are printed to the log file if the request is a slow query. Otherwise, the trace points are discarded. For this printing strategy, the trace log is printed to the log file after the request is determined to be a slow query. In a proxy, for a root span, which is a transaction-level span, the root span is printed to the log file when a slow query is detected. </li><li>SAMPLE_AND_SLOW_QUERY: trace points of all diagnostic information that are traced by full-link trace and whose sampling is enabled are printed to the log file if they meet the following conditions:<ol><li>When the <code>_print_sample_ppm</code> hidden parameter is used for sampling at a probability of 1 per ten thousand, the trace points are printed to the log file only if the sampling result is selected. </li><li>The trace points meet the printing conditions of the ONLY_SLOW_QUERY mode. </li></ol> In this mode, the trace points are not printed to the log file when each span ends. If condition 1 is met, the trace points are marked as forced to be printed in the client, and the information is passed to the subsequent link component. If condition 2 is met, the trace points are printed to the log file when the request is determined to be a slow query. </li></ul> |
