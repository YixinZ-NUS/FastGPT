# Network transmission parameters

| Parameter | Description | Recommended value/range |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| server_tcp_user_timeout | The user timeout period for the TCP connection between OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) and an OBServer node. The default value is `0s`. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| client_tcp_user_timeout | The user timeout period for the TCP connection between ODP and a client. The default value is `0s`. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| client_max_connections | The maximum number of client connections that ODP supports. The default value is `8192`. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| connect_observer_max_retries | The maximum number of retries for ODP to connect to the OBServer node. The default value is `3`. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| observer_query_timeout_delta | The network transmission delay added to the `ob_query_timeout` parameter of an OBServer node, in seconds. Value range: [1, 39]. Default value: 20. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| sock_option_flag_out         | TCP parameters between OBProxy and OBServer. The parameters are represented in binary digits:<ul><li>Bit 0: The first bit in binary. A value of 1 indicates that <code>no_delay</code> is enabled. </li><li>Bit 1: The second bit in binary. A value of 1 indicates that <code>keepalive</code> is enabled. </li><li>Bit 2: The third bit in binary. A value of 1 indicates that <code>linger_on</code> is enabled. </li></ul>The default values of this parameter vary across software versions:<ul><li>For ODP 1.8.x, the default value is 1, which indicates that bit 0 is 1, and <code>no_delay</code> is enabled. </li><li>For ODP 3.x, the default value is 3, which indicates that bits 0 and 1 are 1, and <code>no_delay</code> and <code>linger_on</code> are enabled. </li></ul>| <ul><li>For ODP 1.8.x, we recommend that you set it to 3. </li><li>For ODP 3.x, we recommend that you keep the default value. </li></ul>|
| server_tcp_keepidle | The idle time before a keepalive packet is sent for the TCP connection between an ODP and an OBServer node, in seconds. Default value: 5. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| server_tcp_keepintvl | The interval between two keepalive packets for the TCP connection between an ODP and an OBServer node, in seconds. Default value: 5. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| server_tcp_keepcnt | The maximum number of keepalive packets to be sent for the TCP connection between an ODP and an OBServer node. The default value is `5`. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| client_sock_option_flag_out  | TCP parameters between Client and OBProxy. The parameters are represented in binary digits:<ul><li>Bit 0: The first bit in binary. A value of 1 indicates that <code>no_delay</code> is enabled. </li><li>Bit 1: The second bit in binary. A value of 1 indicates that <code>keepalive</code> is enabled. </li><li>Bit 2: The third bit in binary. A value of 1 indicates that <code>linger_on</code> is enabled. </li></ul>The default values of this parameter vary across software versions:<ul><li>For ODP V1.8.x, the default value is 0, which indicates that no feature is enabled. </li><li>For ODP V3.x, the default value is 2, which indicates that bits 0 and 1 are 1, and <code>keepalive</code> is enabled. </li></ul>| We recommend that you set it to 3, which indicates that bits 0 and 1 are 1, and <code>no_delay</code> and <code>linger_on</code> are enabled. |
| client_tcp_keepidle | The idle time before a keepalive packet is sent for the TCP connection between ODP and a client, in seconds. Default value: 5. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| client_tcp_keepintvl | The interval between two keepalive packets for the TCP connection between ODP and a client, in seconds. Default value: 5. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
| client_tcp_keepcnt | The maximum number of keepalive packets to be sent for the TCP connection between ODP and a client. The default value is `5`. | We recommend that you use the default value. |
