# Monitor historical session performance

Workload Repository (WR) periodically collects data from performance views. It persists and displays the collected active session history (ASH) data, statistics, wait events, and SQL execution information.

## View historical session data

* **Use the `oceanbase.CDB_WR_ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY` view to view ASH data of all tenants after it is persisted.**

  ```shell
  obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_WR_ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY limit 1\G
  ```

    The return result is as follows:

## View SQLSTAT data

* **Use the `GV$OB_SQLSTAT` view to view the basic performance statistics of SQL statements in the cluster.**
  
  Each SQL statement is a row (that is, each unique combination of `SQL_ID` and `Plan_Hash` is a row). The statistics with `_DELTA` in their names indicate the incremental statistics collected from the last WR snapshot to the current time.

  ```shell
  obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_SQLSTAT LIMIT 1\G

* **Use the `V$OB_SQLSTAT` view to view the basic performance statistics of SQL statements on the current node.**
  
  Each SQL statement is a row (that is, each unique combination of `SQL_ID` and `Plan_Hash` is a row). The statistics with `_DELTA` in their names indicate the incremental statistics collected from the last WR snapshot to the current time.

  ```shell
  obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.V$OB_SQLSTAT LIMIT 1\G
