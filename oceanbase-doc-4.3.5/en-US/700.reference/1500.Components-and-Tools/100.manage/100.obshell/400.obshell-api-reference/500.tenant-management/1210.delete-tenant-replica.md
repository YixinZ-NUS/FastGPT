# Delete a tenant replica

This topic describes how to delete a replica of a specified tenant by using the API. The resource pool used by the replica will also be released. You can delete multiple replicas of a specified tenant at a time.

## Call procedure

If a password is set, you must authenticate. For more information, see [API hybrid encryption](../20.api-hybrid-encryption.md).

### Request path

DELETE /api/v1/tenant/:name/replicas

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| zones | []string | Yes | ["zone1","zone2"] | The zones where the replicas to be deleted are located. |

### Return result

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| successful | bool | Indicates whether the request is successful. |
| timestamp | time.Time | The timestamp when the server completes the request. |
| duration | int | The time (in milliseconds) taken by the server to process the request. |
| status | int | The HTTP status code. |
| traceId | string | The Trace ID of the request. |
| data | DagDetailDTO | Information about an asynchronous task. For more information, see the **Data structure of DagDetailDTO** section. |
| error | ApiError | The error generated by the request, which contains the following information:<ul><li>`code`: the error code. </li><li>`message`: the error details. </li><li>`subErrors`: the sub errors. </li></ul> |

The data structure of DagDetailDTO is as follows:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | string | The common ID of the DAG. |
| dag_id | int | The ID of the DAG, which is the primary key in OceanBase Database. |
| name | string | The name of the DAG. |
| stage | int | The current execution stage of the DAG. |
| max_stage | int | The total number of stages in the execution process of the DAG. |
| state | string | The execution status of the DAG. |
| operator | string | The type of the execution operation of the DAG. |
| start_time | time.Time | The start time of the execution of the DAG. |
| end_time | time.Time | The end time of the execution of the DAG. |
| additional_data | map[string]any | Other data of the DAG. |
| nodes | []NodeDetailDTO | Information about all nodes in the DAG. For more information, see [Get node details](../1000.task-management/2100.get-node-detail.md). |
