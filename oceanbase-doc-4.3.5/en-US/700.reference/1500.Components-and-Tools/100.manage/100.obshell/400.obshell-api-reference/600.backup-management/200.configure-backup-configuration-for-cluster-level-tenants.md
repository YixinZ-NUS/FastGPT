# Set cluster-level backup configurations

This topic describes how to set cluster-level backup configurations through the API.

## Call information

### API constraints

If you set a password, you need to authenticate. For more information, see [API hybrid encryption](../20.api-hybrid-encryption.md).

### Request path

POST /api/v1/obcluster/backup/config

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| backup_base_uri | string | Yes | "file:///data/backup" | The base path for storing backup files. After this parameter is set, log archives and data backup files will be stored under this base path. |
| log_archive_concurrency | int | No | 0 | The total number of concurrent threads for log archiving. The default value is 0, and the valid range is [0, 100]. |
| binding | string | No | "optional" | The priority mode for archiving and business. Valid values include `optional` (business priority) and `mandatory` (archival priority). If this parameter is not configured, the optional mode is used by default. |
| ha_low_thread_score | int | No | 0 | The current number of threads for high availability tasks of low priority, such as backup and backup cleanup. You can increase this value appropriately before a backup is performed. We recommend that you double the value each time. The default value is 0, and the valid range is [0, 100]. |
| piece_switch_interval | string | No | 1d | The switching period for pieces. If this parameter is not configured, the default value is 1d, and the valid range is [1d, 7d]. |
| archive_lag_target | string | No | 7200s | The maximum interval between two consecutive log archiving I/O operations. The default value is 2 minutes. Valid values range from 0 ms to 7200 s. |
| delete_policy | DeletePolicy | No | {<br>"delete_policy": "{<br>"policy": "default",<br>"recovery_window": "7d",<br>},<br>} | You can set a cleanup strategy for a tenant after a backup is completed. Tenants with cleanup strategies will trigger automatic cleanup every hour to ensure that expired backups are cleaned up in time. The following table describes the parameters:<ul><li>`policy`: the strategy name. The value is `default` at present. </li><li>`recovery_window`: the window time. It indicates the maximum time from the current time to the data that can be restored. </li></ul>  |

### Return result

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| successful | bool | Whether the request is successful. |
| timestamp | time.Time | The timestamp when the server completes the request. |
| duration | int | The time (in ms) that the server takes to process the request. |
| status | int | The HTTP status code. |
| traceId | string | The Trace ID of the request. |
| data | DagDetailDTO | The asynchronous task information. For more information, see **Data structure of DagDetailDTO**. |
| error | ApiError | The error information generated by the request. It contains the following information:<ul><li>`code`: the error code. </li><li>`message`: the error details. </li><li>`subErrors`: the suberrors. </li></ul> |

The data structure of DagDetailDTO is as follows:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | string | The common ID of the DAG. |
| dag_id | int | The ID of the DAG, which is the primary key in OceanBase Database. |
| name | string | The name of the DAG. |
| stage | int | The current execution stage of the DAG. |
| max_stage | int | The total number of stages in the execution process of the DAG. |
| state | string | The execution status of the DAG. |
| operator | string | The type of DAG execution operation. |
| start_time | time.Time | The start time of DAG execution. |
| end_time | time.Time | The end time of DAG execution. |
| additional_data | map[string]any | Other data of the DAG. |
| nodes | []NodeDetailDTO | Information about all nodes in the DAG. For more information, see [Get node details](../1000.task-management/2100.get-node-detail.md). |
