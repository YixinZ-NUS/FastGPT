# Set the backup configuration for a tenant

This topic describes how to set the backup configuration for a tenant through an API.

## Request parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Example value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data_base_uri | string | Yes | "file:///data/backup/data" | The path for storing data backup files. After the configuration is set, data backup files will be stored in this path. |
| archive_base_uri | string | Yes | "file:///data/backup/clog" | The path for storing log archive files. After the configuration is set, log archive files will be stored in this path. |
| log_archive_concurrency | int | No | 0 | The total number of work threads for log archiving. The default value is 0, and the valid range is [0, 100]. |
| binding | string | No | "optional" | The priority mode for archiving and business. Valid values include `optional` (business takes priority) and `mandatory` (archiving takes priority). The default value is Optional. |
| ha_low_thread_score | int | No | 0 | The number of current work threads for high availability tasks such as backup and backup cleanup. You can increase this value before you start a backup. We recommend that you double the value each time. The default value is 0, and the valid range is [0, 100]. |
| piece_switch_interval | string | No | 1d | The switching cycle for pieces. If this parameter is not specified, the default value is 1d, and the valid range is [1d, 7d]. |
| archive_lag_target | string | No | 7200s | The maximum allowed latency for log archiving. The default value is 2 minutes, which indicates the maximum allowed interval between two consecutive I/Os for log archiving. The valid range is [0ms, 7200s]. |
| delete_policy | DeletePolicy | No | {<br>"delete_policy": "{<br>"policy": "default",<br>"recovery_window": "7d",<br>},<br>} | You can set a cleanup strategy for a tenant after a backup is successful. A tenant with a cleanup strategy will trigger an automatic cleanup every hour to clean up expired backups. The following table describes the parameters in the configuration:<ul><li>`policy`: the strategy name. The value is `default` at present. </li><li>`recovery_window`: the window time. It indicates the period from the current time during which data can be restored. </li></ul> |

### Response parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| successful | bool | Indicates whether the request is successful. |
| timestamp | time.Time | The timestamp when the request is completed on the server. |
| duration | int | The time (in milliseconds) taken by the server to process the request. |
| status | int | The HTTP status code. |
| traceId | string | The Trace ID of the request. |
| data | DagDetailDTO | The asynchronous task information. For more information, see the **Data structure of DagDetailDTO** section. |
| error | ApiError | The error information returned by the request, which contains the following information:<ul><li>`code`: the error code. </li><li>`message`: the error message. </li><li>`subErrors`: the suberror information. </li></ul> |

The data structure of DagDetailDTO is described as follows:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | string | The common ID of the DAG. |
| dag_id | int | The ID of the DAG, which is the primary key in OceanBase Database. |
| name | string | The name of the DAG. |
| stage | int | The current execution stage of the DAG. |
| max_stage | int | The total number of stages in the execution process of the DAG. |
| state | string | The execution status of the DAG. |
| operator | string | The type of the execution operation of the DAG. |
| start_time | time.Time | The start time of the execution of the DAG. |
| end_time | time.Time | The end time of the execution of the DAG. |
| additional_data | map[string]any | Other data of the DAG. |
| nodes | []NodeDetailDTO | Information about all nodes in the DAG. For more information, see [Get node details](../1000.task-management/2100.get-node-detail.md). |
