# Start or stop obshell

## Start obshell

You can use the following syntax to start OceanBase Shell (obshell):

```shell
${home_path}/bin/obshell agent start [--ip] [-P] [--takeover]
```

Here is an example:

```obshell
[admin@test001 ~]$ /home/admin/oceanbase/bin/obshell agent start --ip 10.10.10.1 -P 2886
```

Here, `home_path` specifies the installation directory of OceanBase Database. By default, obshell is installed in the `bin` directory under the installation directory of OceanBase Database.

The following table describes the options in the command.

| Option      | Required? | Data type |  Default value | Description |
|------------|----------|---------|---------|------|
| --ip       | No       | String  | N/A      | The IP address of obshell. |
| -P/--port  | No       | Integer  | 2886    | The port number of obshell. |
| --takeover | No       | Integer     | 1       | Specifies whether to take over the OceanBase cluster. The value `0` indicates not to take over, and other values, including the default value `1`, indicate to take over. |

  <li>If you have started the OceanBase cluster before you start obshell for the first time, you can specify to take over the OceanBase cluster. For more information, see <a href='../200.cluster-management/300.take-over-non-obshell-deployed-clusters.md'>Take over an OceanBase cluster not deployed by obshell</a>. </li>
  <li>If you have started obshell, both the IP address and port number are optional. </li>
  </ul>
</main>

## Stop obshell

You can use the following syntax to stop obshell:

```python
${home_path}/bin/obshell agent stop
```

Here is an example:

```obshell
[admin@test001 ~]$ /home/admin/oceanbase/bin/obshell agent stop
```

Here, `home_path` specifies the installation directory of OceanBase Database. By default, obshell is installed in the `bin` directory under the installation directory of OceanBase Database.
