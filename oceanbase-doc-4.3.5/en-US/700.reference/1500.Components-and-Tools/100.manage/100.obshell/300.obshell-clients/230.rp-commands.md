# obshell resource pool commands

This topic describes the obshell resource pool commands, which are used to query and drop unused resource pools in a cluster. These commands require that the OceanBase cluster has been initialized. You can run the command with the `-h` or `--help` option to view the help information.

## obshell rp drop

Use this command to drop a resource pool that is not used by any tenant in the cluster.

```shell
${home_path}/bin/obshell rp drop <resource_pool_name> [-y]

# example
/home/admin/oceanbasn/bin/obshell rp drop p1 -y
```

`home_path` is the installation directory of OceanBase Database. obshell is located in the `bin` directory of the installation directory by default. `resource_pool_name` is the name of the resource pool to be dropped.

You can specify the `-y` or `--yes` option to skip the confirmation prompt. This option does not take any value.

## obshell rp show

Use this command to display information about a specified resource pool or all resource pools in the cluster.

```shell
${home_path}/bin/obshell rp show [resource_pool_name]

# example
# Display information about a specified resource pool
/home/admin/oceanbase/bin/obshell rp show p1
# Display information about all resource pools in the cluster
/home/admin/oceanbase/bin/obshell rp show
```

`home_path` is the installation directory of OceanBase Database. obshell is located in the `bin` directory of the installation directory by default. `resource_pool_name` is the name of the resource pool to be displayed. If this parameter is not specified, information about all resource pools is displayed.
