# Query the status of a node

This topic describes how to query the current status of the specified OBServer node, such as the identity, process information, and service status of the node, by using obshell-sdk-go.

## Considerations

Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

## Sample code

The sample code for synchronous task execution is as follows:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/oceanbase/obshell-sdk-go/services"
)

func main() {
    var err error // Handle errors in the production environment.
    
    // Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
    // Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
    client, err := services.NewClientWithPassword("10.10.10.1", 2886, "***")

    // Obtain the status of the node.
    status, err := client.V1().GetStatus()
}
```
