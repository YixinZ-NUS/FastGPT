# Upload an RPM package

This topic describes how to upload an RPM package to an OceanBase cluster by using obshell-sdk-go.

## Considerations

* Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

* Make sure that the node corresponding to the client instance that you use belongs to the cluster.

## Sample code

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/oceanbase/obshell-sdk-go/services"
)

func main() {
    var err error // Handle errors in the production environment.
    
    // Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
    // Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
    client, err := services.NewClientWithPassword("10.10.10.1", 2886, "***")

    // Upload an RPM package to the cluster.
    req := client.V1().NewUploadPkgRequest("data/upgrade/obshell-4.2.2.0-xxx.el7.x86_64.rpm")
    _, err = client.V1().UploadPkgWithRequest(req)
}
```
