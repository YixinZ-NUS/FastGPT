# Upgrade OceanBase Database

This topic describes how to upgrade OceanBase Database by using obshell-sdk-go.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>We recommend that you read <a href='../100.quickstart-of-go.md'>Quick start</a> for a better understanding of how to use obshell-sdk-go. </p>
</main>

## Considerations

* Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

* Make sure that the node corresponding to the client instance that you use belongs to the cluster to be upgraded.

## Sample code

:::tab

tab Synchronous task execution

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/oceanbase/obshell-sdk-go/services"
    "github.com/oceanbase/obshell-sdk-go/services/v1"
)

func main() {
    var err error // Handle errors in the production environment.
    
    // Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
    // Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
    client, err := services.NewClientWithPassword("10.10.10.1", 2886, "***")

    // Upgrade OceanBase Database.
    req := client.V1().NewUpgradeObRequest("4.2.2.0", "xxx.el7", v1.PARAM_ROLLING_UPGRADE)
    _, err = client.V1().UpgradeObSyncWithRequest(req)
}
```

tab Asynchronous task execution

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/oceanbase/obshell-sdk-go/services"
    "github.com/oceanbase/obshell-sdk-go/services/v1"
)

func main() {
    var err error // Handle errors in the production environment.
    
    // Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
    // Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
    client, err := services.NewClientWithPassword("10.10.10.1", 2886, "***")

    // Upgrade OceanBase Database.
    req := client.V1().NewUpgradeObRequest("4.2.2.0", "xxx.el7", v1.PARAM_ROLLING_UPGRADE)
    dag, err := client.V1().UpgradeObWithRequest(req)
    // Wait for the task to complete.
    _, err = client.V1().WaitDagSucceed(dag.GenericID)
}
```
