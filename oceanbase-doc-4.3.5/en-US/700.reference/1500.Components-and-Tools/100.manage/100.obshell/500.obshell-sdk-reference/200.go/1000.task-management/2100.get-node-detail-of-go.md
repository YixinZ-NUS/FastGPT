# Obtain the information about a node

This topic describes how to query the information about an OBServer node by using obshell-sdk-go. One or more OBServer nodes comprise a directed acyclic graph (DAG) task.

## Considerations

Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

## Sample code

The sample code for synchronous task execution is as follows:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/oceanbase/obshell-sdk-go/services"
)

func main() {
    var err error // Handle errors in the production environment.
    
    // Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
    // Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
    client, err := services.NewClientWithPassword("10.10.10.1", 2886, "***")

    // Obtain the information about the OBServer node whose generic_id is 20194912107080886.
    node, err := client.V1().GetNode("20194912107080886")
}
```
