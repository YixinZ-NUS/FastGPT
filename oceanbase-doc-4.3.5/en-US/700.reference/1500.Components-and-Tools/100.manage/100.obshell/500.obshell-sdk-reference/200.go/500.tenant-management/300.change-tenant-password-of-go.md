This topic describes how to change the root user password of a tenant by using obshell-sdk-go.

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client for the request must be in an initialized cluster.

* You cannot change the root user password of the system tenant.

## Sample code

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"

  "github.com/oceanbase/obshell-sdk-go/services"
)

func main() {
  // Create a client instance. The node address is '10.10.10.1' and the port is 2886.
  client, err := services.NewClientWithPassword("10.10.10.1", 2886, "****")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Print(err)
    return
  }

  if err := client.V1().SetTenantRootPassword("t1", "old", "new"); err != nil {
    fmt.Print(err)
    return
  }
}
```
