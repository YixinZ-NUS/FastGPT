# Query the last O&M task in an OceanBase cluster

This topic describes how to query the last cluster O&M task in an OceanBase cluster by using obshell-sdk-go.

  <p>We recommend that you read <a href='../100.quickstart-of-go.md'>Quick start</a> for a better understanding of how to use obshell-sdk-go. </p>
</main>

## Considerations

* Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

* Make sure that the node corresponding to the client instance that you use belongs to the cluster to be queried.

## Sample code

The sample code for synchronous task execution is as follows:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/oceanbase/obshell-sdk-go/services"
)

func main() {
    var err error // Handle errors in the production environment.
    
    // Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
    // Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
    client, err := services.NewClientWithPassword("10.10.10.1", 2886, "***")

    // Obtain the last cluster O&M task in the cluster.
    dag, err := client.V1().GetAgentLastMaintenanceDag()
}
```
