# Get information about all tenants in the recycle bin

This topic describes how to use obshell-sdk-go to get information about all tenants in the recycle bin.

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client must be part of an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"

  "github.com/oceanbase/obshell-sdk-go/services"
)

func main() {
  // Create a client instance. The node address is '10.10.10.1' and the port is 2886.
  client, err := services.NewClientWithPassword("10.10.10.1", 2886, "****")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Print(err)
    return
  }

  tenants, err := client.V1().GetAllRecyclebinTenants()
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Print(err)
    return
  }
  fmt.Print(tenants)
}
```
