# Obtain the information about a node

This topic describes how to query the information about an OBServer node by using obshell-sdk-python. One or more OBServer nodes comprise a directed acyclic graph (DAG) task.

## Considerations

Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

## Sample code

The sample code for synchronous task execution is as follows:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
# Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

# Obtain the information about the OBServer node whose generic_id is 20194912107080886.
node = client.v1.get_node("20194912107080886")
```
