## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following example shows how to perform a task synchronously:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the node address '10.10.10.1' and port 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))
client.v1.post_tenant_restore_sync(
    data_backup_uri="file:///data/backup/data",
    tenant_name="rt2",
    zone_list=[
        tenant.ZoneParam("zone1", "unit1",1),
    ],
    archive_log_uri="file:///data/backup/archive",
)
```
