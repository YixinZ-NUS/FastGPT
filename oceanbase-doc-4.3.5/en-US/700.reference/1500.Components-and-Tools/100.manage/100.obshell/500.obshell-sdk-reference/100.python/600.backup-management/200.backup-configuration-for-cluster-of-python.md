This topic describes how to configure cluster-level backup settings by using obshell-sdk-python.

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following sample code shows how to synchronize a task:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, where the node address is '10.10.10.1' and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))
client.v1.post_cluster_backup_config_sync(
    backup_base_uri="file:///data/backup",
    log_archive_concurrency=100,
    ha_low_thread_score=100,
    delete_recovery_window="2d",
)
```
