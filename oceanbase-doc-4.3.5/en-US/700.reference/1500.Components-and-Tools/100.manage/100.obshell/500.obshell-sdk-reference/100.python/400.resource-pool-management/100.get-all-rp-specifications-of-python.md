## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The sample code for synchronously executing a task is as follows:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the node address set to '10.10.10.1' and the port set to 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

pools = client.v1.get_all_resource_pools()
```
