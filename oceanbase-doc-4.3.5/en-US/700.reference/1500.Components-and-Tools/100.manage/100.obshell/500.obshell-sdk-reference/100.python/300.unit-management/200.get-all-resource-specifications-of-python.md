## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node that corresponds to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following example shows how to synchronize a task:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the node address '10.10.10.1' and port 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

unit_configs = client.v1.get_all_resource_unit_configs()
```
