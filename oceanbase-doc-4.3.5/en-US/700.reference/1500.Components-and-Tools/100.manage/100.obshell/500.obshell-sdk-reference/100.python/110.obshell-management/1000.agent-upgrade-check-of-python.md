# Perform an agent upgrade check

This topic describes how to perform a pre-upgrade check for OceanBase Shell (obshell) nodes by using obshell-sdk-python.

  <p>We recommend that you read <a href='../100.quickstart-of-python.md'>Quick start</a> for a better understanding of how to use obshell-sdk-python. </p>

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell runs normally.

* Make sure that the node corresponding to the client instance that you use belongs to the cluster to be upgraded.

## Sample code

:::tab

tab Synchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
# Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

# Perform a pre-upgrade check for obshell nodes in the cluster.
client.v1.upgrade_agent_check_sync("4.2.2.0", "xxx.el7")
```

tab Asynchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
# Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

# Perform a pre-upgrade check for obshell nodes in the cluster.
client.v1.upgrade_agent_check("4.2.2.0", "xxx.el7")
# Wait for the task to complete.
client.v1.wait_dag_succeed(dag.generic_id)
```
