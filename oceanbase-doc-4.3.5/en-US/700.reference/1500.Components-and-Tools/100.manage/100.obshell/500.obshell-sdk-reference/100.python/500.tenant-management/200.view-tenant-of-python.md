## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists.

* The node corresponding to the client in the request must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following example shows how to query tenant information synchronously:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance. The IP address of the node is '10.10.10.1', and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

tenant_info = client.v1.get_tenant_info("t1")
```
