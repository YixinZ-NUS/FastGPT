# Query unfinished OceanBase cluster tasks

This topic describes how to query all unfinished cluster tasks in an OceanBase cluster by using obshell-sdk-python.

</main>

## Considerations

* Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

* Make sure that the node corresponding to the client instance that you use belongs to the cluster to be queried.

## Sample code

The sample code for synchronous task execution is as follows:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
# Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

# Obtain all unfinished cluster tasks.
dag = client.v1.get_cluster_unfinished_dag()
```
