## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client in the request must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following example shows how to execute a task synchronously:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the IP address of the node as '10.10.10.1' and the port as 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

tenants = client.v1.get_all_recyclebin_tenants()
```
