This topic describes how to modify the access whitelist of a tenant by using obshell-sdk-python.

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client in the request must be in an initialized cluster.

* The default value is `127.0.0.1`.

## Sample code

The following sample code shows how to synchronize a task:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the node address '10.10.10.1' and port 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

client.v1.set_tenant_whitelist("t1", "%")
```
