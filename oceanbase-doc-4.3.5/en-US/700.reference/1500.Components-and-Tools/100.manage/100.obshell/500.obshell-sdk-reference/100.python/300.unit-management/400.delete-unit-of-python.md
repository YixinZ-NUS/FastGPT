## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following sample code shows how to execute a task synchronously:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the node address '10.10.10.1' and port 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

client.v1.drop_resource_unit_config("s1")
```
