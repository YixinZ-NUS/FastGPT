## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following example shows how to perform the task synchronously:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the node address '10.10.10.1' and the port 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))
client.v1.post_tenant_backup_config_sync(
    "tenant1",
    "file:///data/backup/data",
    "file:///data/backup/archive"
    log_archive_concurrency=100,
    ha_low_thread_score=100,
    delete_recovery_window="2d",
)
```
