# Set cluster-level configurations

This topic describes how to set cluster-level parameters for an uninitialized OceanBase cluster by using obshell-sdk-python.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>We recommend that you read <a href='../100.quickstart-of-python.md'>Quick start</a> for a better understanding of how to use obshell-sdk-python. </p>
</main>

## Considerations

* Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

* Make sure that the node corresponding to the client instance that you use belongs to the uninitialized cluster.

## Sample code

:::tab

tab Synchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

# Configure the cluster name, the cluster ID, and the password of the root@sys user.
dag = client.v1.config_obcluster_sync("test-sdk", 11, "****")
```

tab Asynchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

# Configure the cluster name, the cluster ID, and the password of the root@sys user.
dag = client.v1.config_obcluster("test-sdk", 11, "****")
# Wait for the task to complete.
client.v1.wait_dag_succeed(dag.generic_id)
```
