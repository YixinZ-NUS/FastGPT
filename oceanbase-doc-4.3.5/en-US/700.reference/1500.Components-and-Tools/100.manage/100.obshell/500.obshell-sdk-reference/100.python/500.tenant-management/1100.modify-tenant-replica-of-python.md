# Modify a tenant replica

This topic describes how to modify the properties of a specified tenant replica by using obshell-sdk-python. You can modify multiple tenant replicas at a time.

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client in the request must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

:::tab

tab Synchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth
from obshell.model import ModifyReplicaParam

# Create a client instance. The node address is '10.10.10.1', and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

# Modify the replica type of the t1 tenant in zone1 to READONLY.
client.v1.modify_tenant_replica_sync(
    "t1", [ModifyReplicaParam("zone1", replica_type="READONLY")])
```

tab Asynchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth
from obshell.model import ModifyReplicaParam

# Create a client instance. The node address is '10.10.10.1', and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

# Modify the replica type of the t1 tenant in zone1 to READONLY.
dag = client.v1.modify_tenant_replica(
    "t1", [ModifyReplicaParam("zone1", replica_type="READONLY")])
# Wait for the task to complete.
client.v1.wait_dag_succeed(dag.generic_id)
```
