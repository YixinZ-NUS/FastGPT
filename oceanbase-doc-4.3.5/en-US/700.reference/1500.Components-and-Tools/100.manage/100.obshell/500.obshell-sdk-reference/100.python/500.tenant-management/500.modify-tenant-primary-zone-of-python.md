# Modify the primary zone of a tenant

This topic describes how to modify the primary zone of a tenant by using obshell-sdk-python.

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client in the request must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

:::tab

tab Synchronous execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, where the node address is '10.10.10.1' and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

client.v1.set_tenant_primary_zone_sync("t1", "RANDOM")
```

tab Asynchronous execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, where the node address is '10.10.10.1' and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

dag = client.v1.set_tenant_primary_zone("t1", "RANDOM")
# Wait for the task to complete.
client.v1.wait_dag_succeed(dag.generic_id)
```
