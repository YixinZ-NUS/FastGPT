# Query tenant system variables

This topic describes how to query tenant system variables by using obshell-sdk-python. It also covers how to query tenant system variables by specifying the variables and how to query tenant system variables by using a wildcard.

## Query a specified system variable

### Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

### Sample code

The following example shows how to query a system variable synchronously:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, specifying the IP address of the node as '10.10.10.1' and the port as 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

variable = client.v1.get_tenant_variable("t1","max_connections")
```

## Query tenant system variables by using a wildcard

### Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

### Sample code

The following example shows how to query tenant system variables synchronously:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, specifying the IP address of the node as '10.10.10.1' and the port as 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

variables = client.v1.get_tenant_variables("t1", "max_connect%")
```
