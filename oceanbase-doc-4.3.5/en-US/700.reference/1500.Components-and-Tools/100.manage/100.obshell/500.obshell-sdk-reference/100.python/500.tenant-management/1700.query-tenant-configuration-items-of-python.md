## Query a specified tenant configuration item

### Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

### Sample code

The following example shows how to perform a task synchronously:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the node address as '10.10.10.1' and the port as 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

client.v1.get_tenant_parameter("t1", "max_partition_num")
```

## Fuzzy query tenant configuration items

### Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

### Sample code

The following example shows how to perform a task synchronously:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the node address as '10.10.10.1' and the port as 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

parameters = client.v1.get_tenant_parameters("t1", "max_partition%")
```
