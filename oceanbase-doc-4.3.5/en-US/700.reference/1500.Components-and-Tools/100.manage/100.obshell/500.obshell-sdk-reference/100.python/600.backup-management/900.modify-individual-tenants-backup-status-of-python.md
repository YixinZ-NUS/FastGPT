## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client in the request must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following sample code shows how to synchronize a task:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance. The node address is '10.10.10.1', and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))
client.v1.patch_tenant_backup_status("tenant1", "canceled")
```
