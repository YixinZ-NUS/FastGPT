# Operate a task

This topic describes how to operate a task by using obshell-sdk-python.

  <p>We recommend that you read <a href='../100.quickstart-of-python.md'>Quick start</a> for a better understanding of how to use obshell-sdk-python. </p>

## Considerations

Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

## Sample code

:::tab

tab Synchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
# Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

try:
    # Initialize the cluster.
    client.v1.init_sync()
except cli.TaskExecuteFailedError as e: # Capture the exception during the execution of the cluster initialization task.
    client.v1.operate_dag_sync(e.dag.generic_id, "ROLLBACK") # Roll back the task.
```

tab Asynchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
# Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

try:
    # Initialize the cluster.
    client.v1.init_sync()
except cli.TaskExecuteFailedError as e: # Capture the exception during the execution of the cluster initialization task.
    client.v1.operate_dag(e.dag.generic_id, "ROLLBACK") # Roll back the task.
```
