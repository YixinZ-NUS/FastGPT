## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node where the client is located must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following sample code demonstrates how to query the overview of all tenants in a cluster:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, where the node address is '10.10.10.1' and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

tenants = client.v1.get_all_tenants()
```
