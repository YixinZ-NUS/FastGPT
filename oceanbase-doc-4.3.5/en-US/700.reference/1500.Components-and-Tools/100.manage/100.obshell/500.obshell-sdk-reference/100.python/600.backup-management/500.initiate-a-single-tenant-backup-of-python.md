## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following example shows how to initiate a backup for a single tenant:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance. The node address is '10.10.10.1' and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))
client.v1.start_tenant_backup_sync("tenant1", "full")
```
