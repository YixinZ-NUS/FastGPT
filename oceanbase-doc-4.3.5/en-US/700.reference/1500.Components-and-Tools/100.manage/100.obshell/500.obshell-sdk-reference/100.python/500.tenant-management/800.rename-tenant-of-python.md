## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following sample code shows how to rename a tenant:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the node address set to '10.10.10.1' and the port set to 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

client.v1.rename_tenant("t1","t2")
```
