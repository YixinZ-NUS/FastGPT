# Query the last O&M task of an obshell node

This topic describes how to query the last O&M task of an OceanBase Shell (obshell) node by using obshell-sdk-python.

## Considerations

Make sure that obshell runs normally.

## Sample code

The sample code for synchronous task execution is as follows:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
# Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

# Obtain the last O&M task of the obshell node.
dag = client.v1.get_agent_last_maintenance_dag()
```
