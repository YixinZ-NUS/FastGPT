## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following sample code shows how to restore a tenant from the recycle bin:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance. The IP address of the node is '10.10.10.1' and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

# Restore the tenant named t1 in the recycle bin to a new tenant named t2.
client.v1.flashback_recyclebin_tenant("t1", new_name="t2")
```
