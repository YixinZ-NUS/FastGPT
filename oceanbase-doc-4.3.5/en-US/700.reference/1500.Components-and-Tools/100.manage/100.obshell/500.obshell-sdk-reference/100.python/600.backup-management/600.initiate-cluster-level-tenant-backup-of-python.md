## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

## Example code

The following example shows how to initiate a cluster-level backup:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the node address '10.10.10.1' and port 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))
client.v1.start_cluster_backup_sync("full")
```
