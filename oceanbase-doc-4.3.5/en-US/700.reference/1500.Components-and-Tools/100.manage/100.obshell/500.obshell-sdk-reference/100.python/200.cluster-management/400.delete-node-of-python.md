# Remove a node before cluster initialization

This topic describes how to remove an OBServer node from an uninitialized OceanBase cluster by using obshell-sdk-python.

  <p>We recommend that you read <a href='../100.quickstart-of-python.md'>Quick start</a> for a better understanding of how to use obshell-sdk-python. </p>
</main>

## Considerations

* Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

* Make sure that the OBServer node to be removed belongs to the uninitialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following code removes the OBServer node with the IP address of `10.10.10.2` and the port number of 2886 from the cluster.

tab Synchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886)

# Remove the OBServer node with the IP address of `10.10.10.2` and the port number of 2886 from the cluster where the node with the IP address of '10.10.10.1' resides.
client.v1.remove_sync("10.10.10.2", 2886)
```

tab Asynchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886)

# Remove the OBServer node with the IP address of `10.10.10.2` and the port number of 2886 from the cluster where the node with the IP address of '10.10.10.1' resides.
client.v1.remove("10.10.10.2", 2886)
# Wait for the task to complete.
client.v1.wait_dag_succeed(dag.generic_id)
```
