## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client in the request must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following example shows how to synchronize a task:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance. The node address is '10.10.10.1' and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

client.v1.set_tenant_variables("t1", {
    "max_connections": 1000,
    "recyclebin": True
})
```
