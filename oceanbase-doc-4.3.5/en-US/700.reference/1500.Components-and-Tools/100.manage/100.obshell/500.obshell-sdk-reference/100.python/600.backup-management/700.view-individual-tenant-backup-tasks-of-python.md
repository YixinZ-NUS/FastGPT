This topic describes how to view a backup task of a tenant by using obshell-sdk-python.

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client of the request must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following example shows how to execute the task synchronously:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the node address of '10.10.10.1' and port 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))
client.v1.get_tenant_backup_overview("tenant1")
```
