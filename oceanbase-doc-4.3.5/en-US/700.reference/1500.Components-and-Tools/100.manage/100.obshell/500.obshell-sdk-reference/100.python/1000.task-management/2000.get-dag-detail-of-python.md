# Obtain the information about a task

This topic describes how to query the information about a directed acyclic graph (DAG) task by using obshell-sdk-python. DAGs are the physical concept of tasks in OceanBase Shell (obshell).

  <p>We recommend that you read <a href='../100.quickstart-of-python.md'>Quick start</a> for a better understanding of how to use obshell-sdk-python. </p>

## Considerations

Make sure that obshell runs normally.

## Sample code

The sample code for synchronous task execution is as follows:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
# Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

# Obtain the information about the DAG task whose generic_id is 20194912107080886.
dag = client.v1.get_dag("20194912107080886")
```
