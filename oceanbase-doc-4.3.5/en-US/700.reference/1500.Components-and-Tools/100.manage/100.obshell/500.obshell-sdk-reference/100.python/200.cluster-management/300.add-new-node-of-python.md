## Considerations

Before adding an OBServer node to an uninitialized OceanBase cluster, take note of the following considerations:

* Make sure that the node corresponding to the client instance that you use is in the cluster to be initialized, unless the node itself is to be added.

* Make sure that the node to be added has not joined any cluster.

* When you add the node corresponding to the client instance that you use, make sure that the node has not joined any cluster and OceanBase Shell (obshell) on the node runs normally.

## Sample code

The following code joins the node with the IP address of `10.10.10.1` as Master Agent and then joins another node with the IP address of `10.10.10.2` as Follower Agent.

tab Synchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886)

# Join the current node.
client.v1.join_sync("10.10.10.1", 2886, "zone1")

# Join the node with the IP address of '10.10.10.2' and the port number of 2886 to the cluster where the node with the IP address of '10.10.10.1' resides.
client.v1.join_sync("10.10.10.2", 2886, "zone1")
```

tab Asynchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886)

# Join the current node.
dag = client.v1.join("10.10.10.1", 2886, "zone1")
# Wait for the task to complete.
client.v1.wait_dag_succeed(dag.generic_id)

# Join the node with the IP address of '10.10.10.2' and the port number of 2886 to the cluster where the node with the IP address of '10.10.10.1' resides.
dag = client.v1.join("10.10.10.2", 2886, "zone1")
# Wait for the task to complete.
client.v1.wait_dag_succeed(dag.generic_id)
```
