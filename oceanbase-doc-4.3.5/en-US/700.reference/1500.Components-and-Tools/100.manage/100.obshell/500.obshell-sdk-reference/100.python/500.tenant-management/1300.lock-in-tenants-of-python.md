This topic describes how to lock a tenant by using obshell-sdk-python. A locked tenant cannot establish new connections.

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client in the request must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following sample code shows how to lock a tenant:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the node address '10.10.10.1' and port 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

client.v1.lock_tenant("t1")
```
