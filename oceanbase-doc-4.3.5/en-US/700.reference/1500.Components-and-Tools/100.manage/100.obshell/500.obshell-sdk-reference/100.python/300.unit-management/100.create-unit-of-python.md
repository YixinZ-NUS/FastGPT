This topic describes how to create a resource specification by using obshell-sdk-python.

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client in the request must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following sample code shows how to execute a task synchronously:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance. The IP address of the node is '10.10.10.1', and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

client.v1.create_resource_unit_config("s1", memory_size="5G", max_cpu=4)
```
