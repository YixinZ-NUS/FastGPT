# Query the status of a node

This topic describes how to query the current status of the specified OBServer node, such as the identity, process information, and service status of the node, by using obshell-sdk-python.

## Considerations

Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

## Sample code

The sample code for synchronous task execution is as follows:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
# Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

# Obtain the status of the node.
status = client.v1.get_status()
```
