  <p>We recommend that you first read <a href='../100.quickstart-of-python.md'>obshell-sdk-python Quick Start</a> to learn how to use obshell-sdk-python.</p>
</main>

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

:::tab

tab Synchronous execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, where the node address is '10.10.10.1' and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

client.v1.purge_recyclebin_tenant_sync("t1")
```

tab Asynchronous execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, where the node address is '10.10.10.1' and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

dag = client.v1.purge_recyclebin_tenant("t1")
# Wait for the task to complete.
client.v1.wait_dag_succeed(dag.generic_id)
```
