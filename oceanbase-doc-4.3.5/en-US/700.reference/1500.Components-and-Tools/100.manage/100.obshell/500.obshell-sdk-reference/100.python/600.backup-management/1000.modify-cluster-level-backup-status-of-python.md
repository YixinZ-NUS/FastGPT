## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following example shows how to synchronize a task:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, specifying the node address as '10.10.10.1' and the port as 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))
client.v1.patch_cluster_backup_status("canceled")
```
