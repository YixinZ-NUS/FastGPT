## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client must be in an initialized cluster.

* You cannot change the root user password of the system tenant.

## Sample code

The following sample code shows how to change the password of a tenant synchronously:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the node address '10.10.10.1' and port 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

client.v1.set_tenant_root_password("t1", new_password="****", old_password="****")
```
