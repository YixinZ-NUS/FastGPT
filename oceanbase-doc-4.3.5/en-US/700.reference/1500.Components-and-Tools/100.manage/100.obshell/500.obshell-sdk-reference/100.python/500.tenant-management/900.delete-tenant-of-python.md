This topic describes how to drop a specified tenant by using obshell-sdk-python.

  <p>We recommend that you first read <a href='../100.quickstart-of-python.md'>Get started with obshell-sdk-python</a> to learn how to use obshell-sdk-python. </p>
</main>

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* Make sure that the tenant exists and is in the NORMAL state.

* The node corresponding to the client in the request is in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

:::tab

tab Synchronous execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance with the node address '10.10.10.1' and port 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))

client.v1.drop_tenant_sync("t1")
```

tab Asynchronous execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth
from obshell.model import ZoneParam

# Create a client instance with the node address '10.10.10.1' and port 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

dag = client.v1.drop_tenant("t1")
# Wait for the task to complete.
client.v1.wait_dag_succeed(dag.generic_id)
```
