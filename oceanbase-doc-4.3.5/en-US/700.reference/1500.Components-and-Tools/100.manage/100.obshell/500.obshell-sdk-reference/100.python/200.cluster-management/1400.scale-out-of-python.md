## Considerations

Before scaling out an OceanBase cluster, take note of the following considerations:

* Make sure that the node corresponding to the client instance that you use belongs to the cluster to be scaled out.

* Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

* Make sure that the node to be added has not joined any cluster.

## Sample code

:::tab

tab Synchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
# Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

configs = {
    "datafile_size": "24G", "log_disk_size": "24G", 
    "cpu_count": "16", "memory_limit": "16G", "system_memory": "8G", 
    "enable_syslog_recycle": "true", "enable_syslog_wf": "true"}
# Add the OBServer node with the IP address of '10.10.10.4' and the port number of 2886 to zone 3 of the cluster. The configurations are specified as configs.
client.v1.scale_out_sync("10.10.10.4", 2886, "zone3", configs)
```

tab Asynchronous task execution

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
# Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

configs = {
    "datafile_size": "24G", "log_disk_size": "24G", 
    "cpu_count": "16", "memory_limit": "16G", "system_memory": "8G", 
    "enable_syslog_recycle": "true", "enable_syslog_wf": "true"}
# Add the OBServer node with the IP address of '10.10.10.4' and the port number of 2886 to zone 3 of the cluster. The configurations are specified as configs.
client.v1.scale_out("10.10.10.4", 2886, "zone3", configs)
# Wait for the task to complete.
client.v1.wait_dag_succeed(dag.generic_id)
```
