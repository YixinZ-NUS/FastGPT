This topic describes how to view cluster-level tenant backup tasks by using obshell-sdk-python.

## Considerations

* Make sure that obshell is running.

* The node corresponding to the client in the request must be in an initialized cluster.

## Sample code

The following sample code shows how to synchronize the task:

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, where the IP address is '10.10.10.1' and the port is 2886.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PassswordAuth("****"))
client.v1.get_cluster_backup_overview()
```
