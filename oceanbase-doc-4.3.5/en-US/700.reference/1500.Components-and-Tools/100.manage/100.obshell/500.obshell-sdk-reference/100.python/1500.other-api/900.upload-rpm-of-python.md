This topic describes how to upload an RPM package to an OceanBase cluster by using obshell-sdk-python.

## Considerations

* Make sure that OceanBase Shell (obshell) runs normally.

* Make sure that the node corresponding to the client instance that you use belongs to the cluster.

## Sample code

```python
from obshell import ClientSet
from obshell.auth import PasswordAuth

# Create a client instance, with the IP address of "10.10.10.1" and the port number of 2886.
# Enter the root@sys password "****" for the cluster.
client = ClientSet("10.10.10.1", 2886, PasswordAuth("****"))

# Upload an RPM package to the cluster.
client.v1.upload_pkg("data/upgrade/obshell-4.2.2.0-xxx.el7.x86_64.rpm")
```
