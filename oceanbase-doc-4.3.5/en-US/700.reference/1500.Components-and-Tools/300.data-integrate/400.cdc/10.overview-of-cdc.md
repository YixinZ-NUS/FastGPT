# OceanBase Binlog Service

OceanBase Binlog Service (OceanBase Binlog Service, abbreviated as Binlog Service) collects transaction logs from OceanBase Database and converts them into MySQL Binlog for real-time data subscription and other scenarios.

## Components involved

OceanBase Binlog Service consists of the following three components:

* OceanBase Database: the business database that generates Binlog logs.

* OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP): the OBProxy that provides connection services for clients subscribing to Binlog logs.

* OceanBase Binlog Tool: the core component of OceanBase Binlog Service, obbinlog (formerly oblogproxy), which pulls clogs and generates Binlog logs.
