## FAQ

What do I do if the following error occurs due to the missing dynamic library `libobcdc.so.4` when I run the obcdc_tailf command?

```shell
./bin/obcdc_tailf: error while loading shared libraries: libobcdc.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

You can use the `find` command to find the path of `libobcdc.so.4` and then set the environment variable to specify the dynamic library search path. The procedure is as follows:

1. Run the `find` command to find the path of `libobcdc.so.4`.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ find / -name libobcdc.so.4
   ```

   The path of `libobcdc.so.4` is returned if `libobcdc.so.4` exists in the environment, as shown in the following example:

   ```shell
   /home/admin/oceanbase-ce/lib/libobcdc.so.4
   ```

2. Set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to specify the dynamic library search path.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/admin/oceanbase-ce/lib/
   ```
