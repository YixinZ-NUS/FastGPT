# Restore process

This topic describes the physical restore process.

## Tenant-level restore

The restore process in OceanBase Database is as follows:

1. RootService creates the required log streams based on the backup data.

2. The leader of the log streams dispatches the data and logs restored on it, and the followers pull data and logs from the leader.

3. After RootService detects that all log streams are restored, it considers that tenant data restore is completed.

For a single partition, the backup and restore process is similar to the server restart process and involves the loading of data and application logs.

## Table-level restore

1. Restore the auxiliary tenant: Restore the auxiliary tenant to the specified time point from the backup data.

2. Cross-tenant table migration: Migrate the specified tables from the auxiliary tenant to the target tenant.

3. Drop the auxiliary tenant.

## Restore transaction consistency

In OceanBase Database, physical backup and restore depends on the Global Timestamp Service (GTS) feature of tenants. GTS ensures global consistency between the backed up and restored data.
