# Columnstore replica

A columnstore replica is similar to a read-only replica. It does not participate in leader election or log voting and consists of an SSTable, commit logs (clogs), and a MemTable. In a columnstore replica, the baseline data of the user table is stored in columnar storage mode. Here, the user table can be a replicated table, but not an index table, internal table, or system table.

A columnstore replica has the following characteristics:

* Contains full logs, a MemTable, and an SSTable.

* Cannot join a Paxos group or participate in log voting as a member of the Paxos group. Instead, it works as a listener that synchronizes logs from the Paxos group members and then locally replays the logs. It does not act as a voting member and therefore causes no latency in transaction commits.

* Provides read-only services if an application does not require strong-consistency reads.

* Stores user tables in the same log stream in columnar storage mode at the major SSTable layer.

* Cannot be converted into a replica of another type.

The following table describes more features of such a replica.

| Replica name and abbreviation        | COLUMNSTORE (C)                                   |
| Whether logs are contained           | It has asynchronous logs. It is only a listener instead of a member of the Paxos group (ASYNC_CLOG). |
| Whether a MemTable is contained     | Yes (WITH_MEMSTORE)                              |
| Whether an SSTable is contained       | Yes (WITH_SSSTORE)       |
| Data security             | Medium                                             |
| Time to become the leader  | Not supported                                           |
| Resource cost             | High                                             |
| Service                 | Supports non-consistent read.                                        |
| Limitations on replica type conversion       | Cannot be converted into a replica of another type                                    |
