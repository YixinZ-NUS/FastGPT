# DCL

You can use Data Control Language (DCL) to control data access permissions. DCL can manage access permissions for specific accounts to specific database resources.

## Default permission models

Different database systems have different default permission models:

* **Oracle mode**: In Oracle, when a user is created, the system automatically creates a Schema with the same name as the user. For example, user `SCOTT` owns Schema `SCOTT`, and this user automatically becomes the owner of all objects in this Schema. Schema owners can access objects in their own Schema without additional authorization, while other users need to be granted permission.

* **MySQL mode**: Data does not have an Owner concept. Authorization is required to access data.

## Common DCL commands

DCL mainly includes two operations: granting permissions (GRANT) and revoking permissions (REVOKE).

## Example

Grant query permission on table `ta` in Schema A to user B:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON a.ta TO b;
```

Revoke query permission on table `ta` in Schema A from user B:

```sql
REVOKE SELECT ON a.ta FROM b;
```
