# OceanBase plugin mechanism

With the evolution of database technology and the diversification of business scenarios, flexibility and scalability have become core capabilities of modern distributed database systems. To adapt to this trend, OceanBase Database introduces a plugin mechanism, providing users with a modular and non-intrusive way to extend database functionality. With this mechanism, users can dynamically load, unload, and update feature modules without modifying the core code, enabling efficient customization and expansion of the database.

  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p><ul><li>For OceanBase Database V4.3.5, the plugin mechanism is supported starting from V4.3.5 BP1.</li><li>The plugin mechanism is currently experimental and is not recommended for production environments.</li></ul></p>
</main>

## Simplified expansion

The plugin mechanism allows users to add new features to OceanBase Database without modifying the core code. This modular design makes feature expansion easier and more intuitive.

## Efficient updates

The plugin mechanism supports rapid iteration and updates. Users can quickly access and apply the latest feature enhancements and bug fixes. This ensures that the system remains in an optimal state to meet evolving business needs.

## Customized features

The plugin mechanism allows users to customize features based on their business requirements, enhancing the system's flexibility and adaptability. Users can selectively load or unload plugins to ensure that the system runs only the necessary feature modules.

## Community and ecosystem support

Through the plugin mechanism, OceanBase Database users can share and publish custom plugins, fostering collaboration and enriching the plugin ecosystem. This enhances the functional diversity of OceanBase Database and fosters community growth.

## Experimental feature

The plugin mechanism of OceanBase Database is currently in the experimental stage, with its functionality and stability being gradually enhanced. At present, the plugin mechanism supports the following scenarios:

* Tokenizer plugins: Extend the database's full-text search capabilities, allowing users to implement custom tokenization logic.  
* Feature verification: Enable users to try out the plugin mechanism in advance and provide feedback for future feature expansions.

In the future, OceanBase Database will expand the application scenarios for the plugin mechanism and improve its stability and performance in production environments.
