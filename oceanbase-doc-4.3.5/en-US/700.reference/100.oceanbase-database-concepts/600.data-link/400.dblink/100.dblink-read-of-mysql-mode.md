# DBLink in MySQL mode

## Read functionality of DBLink in MySQL mode

OceanBase DBLink allows you to access remote database resources as if you were accessing local databases. In the current MySQL mode, the read functionality of DBLink is used to access data in MySQL tenants of remote OceanBase clusters from MySQL tenants of a local OceanBase cluster. The read functionality of DBLink can also be used to access data between MySQL tenants in the same OceanBase cluster.

MySQL DBLink supports the following data types:

- **Numeric types**: TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT, BIGINT, FLOAT, DOUBLE, and DECIMAL
- **Time types**: DATE, TIME, YEAR, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP
- **Character types**: CHAR and VARCHAR
- **Other types**: ENUM and SET

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Due to the limitations of OBClient, columns of the ENUM and SET types are treated as VARCHAR columns. </p>

## Considerations

You cannot read data from a native MySQL database through a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, nor can you read data from a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database to a native MySQL database.
