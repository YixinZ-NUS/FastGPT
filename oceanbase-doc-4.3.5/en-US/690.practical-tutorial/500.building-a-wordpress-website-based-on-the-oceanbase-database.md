# Build a WordPress website with OceanBase Database

This topic describes how to build a WordPress website using OceanBase Database.

## Background information

* WordPress: WordPress is an open-source content management system (CMS) built with PHP and MySQL. For more information, visit [WordPress's official website](https://www.hostinger.com/wordpress-hosting?ppc_campaign=google_search_generic_hosting_wordpress&bidkw=wordpress&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIi9-WkdmIigMV8lsPAh2tpR84EAAYASAAEgIgo_D_BwE). Due to its ease of use, scalability, and strong community support, WordPress is a popular choice for many users. This topic uses WordPress to demonstrate how to build a website on OceanBase Database.
* MAMP: MAMP is a software package for macOS and Windows that provides a complete local development environment. It allows developers to easily develop and test PHP and MySQL-based web applications on their local machines, making it a suitable runtime environment for WordPress. For more information, visit [MAMP's official website](https://www.mamp.info/). 


## Prerequisites

* You have deployed an OceanBase cluster of V4.3.3 or later and created a MySQL tenant. For more information about how to deploy an OceanBase cluster, see [Deployment overview](../400.deploy/100.deploy-overview.md).

* The MySQL tenant you created has been granted insert and query privileges. For more information about how to grant privileges, see [Grant direct privileges](../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/200.authority-of-mysql-mode.md).

* You have created a database. For more information, see [Create a database](../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/300.database-object-planning-of-mysql-mode/100.create-database-of-mysql-mode-in-develop.md).

* You have installed Apache and PHP.

  * Run the following command to install Apache.

    ```shell
    brew install httpd
    ```

  * Run the following command to install PHP.

    ```shell
    brew install php

## Procedure

1. Install WordPress.

    1. Run the following command to download WordPress.

        ```shell
        curl -O https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
        ```

    2. Run the following command to decompress WordPress.

        ```shell
        tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
        ```

    3. Rename the decompressed WordPress folder to your desired name (such as `your-wordpress-site`) and move it to the `htdocs` directory of MAMP. The path is typically `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/`.

        ```shell
        mv wordpress /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/your-wordpress-site
        ```

2. Edit the WordPress configuration file.

    * Edit the `wp-config-sample.php` file in your WordPress installation directory to configure database connection details.

        ```php
            /** The name of the database for WordPress */
            define('DB_NAME', 'your_db_name');    ## Set the database name.
            /** MySQL database username */
            define('DB_USER', 'your_db_user');    ## Set the tenant and username.
            /** MySQL database password */
            define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_db_password');  ## Set the password of the tenant user.
            /** MySQL hostname */
            define('DB_HOST', 'your_ob_cloud_host'); // ## Set the IP address and port of the tenant.
        ```

    * Edit the `class-wpdb.php` file in WordPress to replace `utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci` with `utf8mb4_general_ci`.

        ```php
            if ( $this->has_cap( 'utf8mb4_520' ) && 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci' === $collate ) {
                        $collate = 'utf8mb4_general_ci';
                    }
        ```
