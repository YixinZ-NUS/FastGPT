# Overview

This topic describes the compatibility between OceanBase Database's Oracle mode and native Oracle Database.

OceanBase Database is compatible with Oracle Database in terms of basic features, including the data types, SQL features, and database objects. OceanBase Database is compatible with most Procedural Language (PL)-related R&D features of Oracle Database. In terms of advanced features such as database security, backup and restore, high availability, and optimizer, OceanBase Database provides sound compatibility with and even outperforms Oracle Database. Therefore, you can smoothly migrate data and services from Oracle Database to OceanBase Database without spending much time learning everything about OceanBase Database.

However, due to differences in underlying architecture and product structure, there are some features that OceanBase Database does not support or where it behaves differently from Oracle Database. This topic covers the compatibility between OceanBase Database's Oracle mode and Oracle Database in the following areas:

* SQL data types

* Built-in functions

* SQL syntaxes

* PL features

* System views

* Character sets

* Collations

* Database object management

* Security features

* Backup and restore

* SQL engine

## SQL data types

OceanBase Database is compatible with most of the data types supported by Oracle Database. For more information, see [SQL data types](../400.compatibility-with-oracle/200.sql-data-type.md).

However, for optimization reasons, the `LONG` and `LONG RAW` data types are considered too outdated, and OceanBase Database currently has no plans to support these two data types.

## Built-in functions

OceanBase Database is compatible with most of the built-in functions supported by Oracle Database. For more information, see [Built-in functions](../400.compatibility-with-oracle/300.built-in-functions.md).

## SQL syntaxes

OceanBase Database supports most of the SQL syntaxes in Oracle Database. For some unsupported SQL syntaxes, OceanBase Database will return an "unsupported syntax" error to indicate that the corresponding features are unavailable.

:::tab
tab Supported

**SELECT**

* Supports most query features, including single- and multi-table queries, subqueries, inner joins, semi joins, outer joins, grouping, aggregation, hierarchical queries, and regular data mining functions such as probability and linear regression functions.

* Supports the following collection operations: `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `MINUS`.

* Supports the `EXPLAIN` statement for viewing execution plans.

**INSERT**

* Supports single- and multi-row inserts, as well as insertion into a specified partition.

* Supports the `INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...` statement.

* Supports single- and multi-table inserts.

**UPDATE**

* Supports single- and multi-column updates.

* Supports updates by using subqueries.

* Supports collection updates.

**DELETE**

* Supports single- and multi-table deletion.

**TRUNCATE**

* Supports the truncation of a specified table.

**Parallel queries**

* Supports parallel queries similar to those in Oracle Database.

  OceanBase Database supports the auto degree of parallelism (DOP) feature. You can also manually specify the DOP by using hints or session variables.

* Supports parallel DML statements.

**Hint**

OceanBase Database supports hints. For more information about hints, see [Hint](../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/300.basic-elements-of-oracle-mode/600.annotation-of-oracle-mode/400.hint-of-oracle-mode/100.hint-overview-of-oracle-mode.md).

**Materialized views**

* Supports the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement for creating a materialized view.
* Supports the `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement for dropping a materialized view.

**Materialized view logs**

* Supports the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG` statement for creating a materialized view log.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The default behavior of <code>with_clause</code> (where you can specify <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>, <code>ROWID</code>, and <code>SEQUENCE</code>) in the <code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG</code> statement in OceanBase Database is incompatible with those in Oracle Database. </p>
  </main>

* Supports the `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG` statement for dropping a materialized view log.

tab Not supported

**Materialized views**

* Does not support the `ON COMMIT` or `ON STATMENT` refresh mode in the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement.
* Does not support the `PRESERVE TABLE` clause in the `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement.

**Materialized view logs**

* Does not support the following items in the syntax of the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG` statement:

  * The `ASYNCHRONOUS` clause for asynchronous purging.
  *  The `EXCLUDING NEW VALUES` clause. If it is used, OceanBase Database returns an error.
  * Partitions.

## PL features

OceanBase Database is compatible with most PL features of Oracle Database. For more information, see [PL reference](../../700.reference/600.pl-reference/100.what-is-pl/100.pl-introduction.md).

:::tab
tab Supported

OceanBase Database supports the following PL features of Oracle Database:

* Data types

* Process control

* Collections and records (multi-dimensional collections are not supported)

* Static SQL statements

* Dynamic SQL statements

* Subprograms

* Triggers

* Exception handling

* Packages

* Performance optimization

* Custom data types

* PL packages, including `DBMS_CRYPTO`, `DBMS_DEBUG`, `DBMS_LOB`, `DBMS_LOCK`, `DBMS_METADATA`, `DBMS_OUTPUT`, `DBMS_RANDOM`, `DBMS_SQL`, `DBMS_XA`, `UTL_I18N`, and `UTL_RAW`

* PL tag security packages, including `SA_SYSDBA`, `SA_COMPONENTS`, `SA_LABEL_ADMIN`, `SA_POLICY_ADMIN`, `SA_USER_ADMIN`, and `SA_SESSION`

In the implementation of `NOCOPY` for a parameter, compatibility between OceanBase Database and Oracle Database varies as follows:

* If the parameter is of a basic data type or the parameter has the OUT attribute and is of a complex data type, OceanBase Database is incompatible with the pass-by-reference behavior in Oracle Database.

* If the parameter has the IN OUT attribute and is of a complex data type, OceanBase Database is compatible with the pass-by-reference behavior in Oracle Database.

tab Not supported

OceanBase Database does not support the following PL feature of Oracle Database:

* Conditional compilation
