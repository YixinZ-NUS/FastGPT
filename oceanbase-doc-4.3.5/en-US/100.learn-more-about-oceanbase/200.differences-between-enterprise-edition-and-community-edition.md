# Differences between Enterprise Edition and Community Edition

OceanBase Database is available in two forms: OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition and OceanBase Database Community Edition.

* OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition is an enterprise-level, native distributed database independently developed by the OceanBase team. It provides financial-grade high availability on commodity hardware. Its groundbreaking deployment mode of "five IDCs across three regions" sets a new standard for automatic, lossless disaster recovery at the region level. OceanBase Database has also set new records in the TPC-C benchmark test, supporting more than 1,500 nodes in one cluster. It is cloud-native, highly consistent, and highly compatible with Oracle and MySQL.

* OceanBase Database Community Edition is an integrated database that supports both standalone and distributed deployment modes. It is built on the native distributed architecture and supports enterprise-level features such as financial-grade high availability, transparent horizontal scaling, distributed transactions, multitenancy, and syntax compatibility. OceanBase Database Community Edition is open-source and compatible with MySQL. It not only supports connectivity with virtualization and big data applications and products, but also supports a comprehensive range of GUI-based development tools, O&M and monitoring tools, and data migration tools. In addition, it provides open APIs and various eco-capabilities to meet the business requirements of enterprises or individuals.

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>In this topic, a distributed transaction is an internal transaction within an OceanBase cluster. A distributed transaction is supported only in one tenant although the data that the transaction accesses involves multiple participants. eXtended Architecture (XA) ensures the atomicity of committing cross-database transactions. If a global transaction of an application accesses data in multiple databases, an external distributed transaction manager that is independent from OceanBase Database can call an XA transaction interface to ensure the atomicity of committing the global transaction. This way, the global transaction can also be seen as an XA transaction. </p>
