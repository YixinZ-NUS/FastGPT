# Performance testing

As a high-performance distributed relational database, OceanBase can demonstrate its performance in AP scenarios through standard benchmarks such as Sysbench and TPC-H. The following analysis is presented from two perspectives:

## Sysbench benchmark test of OceanBase Database

The Sysbench benchmark test verifies the transaction throughput (QPS) and latency of OceanBase Database in high-concurrency scenarios and compares its performance with that of a conventional standalone database (such as MySQL).

## TPC-H benchmark test of OceanBase Database

The TPC-H benchmark test is an international standard business intelligence (BI) benchmark test that includes 22 complex queries covering scenarios such as aggregation, join, and sorting. The key metrics of the TPC-H benchmark test include:

- QphH@size: the ratio of the number of queries processed per hour (QphH) to the data size (in GB).
- Response time: the time taken for each query from submission to result return.
