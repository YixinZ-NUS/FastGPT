# Data visualization

As a distributed database, OceanBase Database excels at handling massive data storage and computation. By integrating with mainstream BI tools (such as Superset and Power BI), OceanBase Database enables users to quickly transform complex data into intuitive charts, supporting business decision-making, real-time monitoring, and multidimensional analysis.

## Supported BI tools

### Apache Superset

- **Flexible customization**: Supports direct SQL queries on OceanBase tables, allowing customization of dashboards and data boards.
- **SQL query optimization**: Leverages OceanBase Database's HTAP capabilities to execute complex analytical SQL directly in Superset.
