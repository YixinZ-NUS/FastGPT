# Overview

You can select an appropriate product edition, deployment solution, and deployment mode as needed.

## Select an appropriate product edition

OceanBase Database is available in two editions: OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition and OceanBase Database Community Edition.

* OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition is an enterprise-level, native distributed database independently developed by the OceanBase team. It provides financial-grade high availability on commodity hardware. Its groundbreaking deployment mode of "five IDCs across three regions" sets a new standard for automatic, lossless disaster recovery at the region level. OceanBase Database has also set new records in the TPC-C benchmark test, supporting more than 1,500 nodes in one cluster. It is cloud-native, highly consistent, and highly compatible with Oracle and MySQL.
* OceanBase Database Community Edition is an integrated database that supports both standalone and distributed deployment and that is compatible with MySQL. It is built on the native distributed architecture and supports enterprise-level features such as financial-grade high availability, transparent horizontal scaling, distributed transactions, multitenancy, and syntax compatibility. OceanBase Database Community Edition has an open-source kernel and provides open APIs and various eco-capabilities to meet the business requirements of enterprises or individuals.

For more information about the differences between the Enterprise Edition and the Community Edition, see [Differences between the features of the Enterprise Edition and the Community Edition](../../100.learn-more-about-oceanbase/200.differences-between-enterprise-edition-and-community-edition.md).

## Select an appropriate deployment solution

OceanBase Database supports high availability and disaster recovery at the node, Internet data center (IDC), and region levels. You can deploy OceanBase Database in a single IDC, in two IDCs in the same region, in three IDCs across two regions, or in five IDCs across three regions. You can also deploy the arbitration service to reduce costs.

For more information about each deployment solution, see [HA deployment solutions for OceanBase clusters](../../400.deploy/200.introduction-to-oceanbase-cluster-high-availability-deployment-scheme.md).

## Select an appropriate deployment mode

|**Product edition**|**Scenario**|**Recommended deployment mode**|**Deployment tool**|
|---|---|---|---|
| **OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition** | Production environment | We recommend that you use OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) to deploy an OceanBase cluster. <br/>For more information, see [Deploy a three-replica OceanBase cluster by using OCP](../../400.deploy/300.deploy-oceanbase-enterprise-edition/300.deploy-through-a-graphical-interface/300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/500.deploy-three-oceanbase-replica-clusters-use-ocp.md). | OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT) and OCP |
|**OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition** | Non-production environment | You can use the command-line interface (CLI) to deploy an OceanBase cluster. <br/>For more information, see [Deploy a three-replica OceanBase cluster by using the CLI](../../400.deploy/300.deploy-oceanbase-enterprise-edition/400.deploy-through-the-command-line/200.deploy-the-oceanbase-cluster-command-line/400.deploy-three-oceanbase-replica-clusters.md). | oat-cli |
| **OceanBase Database Community Edition** | Online environment | We recommend that you use OceanBase Deployer (obd) for standard deployment. <br/>For more information, see [Deploy an OceanBase cluster through the GUI of obd](../../400.deploy/500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/200.local-deployment/400.deploy-by-ui/100.deploy-by-obd.md). | obd |
| **OceanBase Database Community Edition** | Kubernetes environment | We recommend that you use ob-operator for deployment. <br/>For more information, see [Deploy OceanBase Database in a Kubernetes cluster](../../400.deploy/500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/300.deploy-in-the-k8s-cluster.md). | ob-operator |
| **OceanBase Database Community Edition** | Quick experience with OceanBase Database in a non-natively supported operating system such as macOS or Windows | We recommend that you use a Docker image for deployment. <br/>For more information, see [Deploy OceanBase Database in a container](../../400.deploy/500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/200.local-deployment/700.deploy-by-docker.md). |  |

## Plan your resources

After you select an appropriate deployment solution, you must plan and prepare the resources required for the deployment.
For more information about the configuration requirements for servers, see [Prepare servers](../../400.deploy/300.deploy-oceanbase-enterprise-edition/200.preparations-before-deploy/100.prepare-servers.md).

## Deploy columnstore replicas

To support TP-enhanced hybrid workloads (near real-time decision analysis scenarios), OceanBase Database provides support for read-only columnstore replicas. Users can deploy columnstore replicas on independent zones. On a columnstore replica, all user tables (including replicated tables but excluding index tables, internal tables, and system tables) are stored in columnar format. OLAP workloads access columnstore replicas through a dedicated ODP entry and execute decision analysis tasks using weak read mode.

From the perspective of log streams, all user tables within the same log stream on a columnstore replica are stored in pure columnar mode at the major sstable layer. Apart from this, columnstore replicas follow all the rules of regular read-only replicas regarding replica distribution and weak read release mechanisms. Except for the difference in major sstable storage type, columnstore replicas are similar to read-only replicas: they do not participate in elections or log voting, and each possesses a complete set of sstable, clog, and memtable.

After deploying a columnstore replica, you need to configure routing and weak read requests to ensure that OLAP requests are automatically converted to weak read requests and forwarded to the corresponding columnstore replica.

## Considerations on using columnstore replicas

- When using columnstore replicas, no additional operations are required for the OceanBase cluster. You can deploy them according to the standard architecture.

- Since accessing a columnstore replica requires deploying a dedicated ODP, it is recommended to deploy only columnstore replicas in zones where they are present. Additionally, the ODP version must be V4.3.2 or above.

- When creating a tenant, you can specify a replica in a particular zone as a columnstore replica by setting the locality. For more information on creating tenants, see CREATE TENANT.

- When using columnstore replicas, you need to configure routing and weak read requests. For more information on using columnstore replicas, see [Use columnstore replicas](../../600.manage/300.replica-management/150.the-use-of-columnstore-replica.md).
