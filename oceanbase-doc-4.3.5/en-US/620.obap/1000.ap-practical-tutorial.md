## Build a real-time data warehouse based on Flink and OceanBase

**Objective**: This tutorial leverages OceanBase's HTAP capabilities and Flink's unified stream and batch processing to demonstrate how to construct a data hierarchy—from the Operational Data Store (ODS), to the Data Warehouse Detail Layer (DWD), and finally to the Application Data Store (ADS)—using scheduled tasks. It also covers setting up a visual dashboard using supporting ecosystem tools.

For detailed steps, see [Build a real-time data warehouse and visual dashboard with OceanBase](../690.practical-tutorial/300.dw_based_on_ob.md).

## Rapidly process and analyze massive data in OceanBase using Spark

**Objective**: Utilizing OceanBase's strong consistency and distributed query capabilities, together with Spark's distributed computing framework and OceanBase's high scalability, this tutorial aims to maximize data processing speed and system responsiveness.
