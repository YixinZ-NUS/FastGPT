# Preparations

Before you perform restore, you need to create the resources for the tenant to be restored.

## Considerations

Before performing a recovery operation, please ensure the version of the backup data to be recovered. OceanBase Database currently only supports the following versions:

* It only supports restoring lower version backup data to the same version or a higher version. Cross-version recovery within minor versions of the same major version is not supported.
* Recovery from version 4.2.x to 4.3.x is not supported for now.
* Backup data from versions V4.3.0/4.3.1/4.3.2 cannot be directly restored on version V4.3.3 for now.  

## Procedure

1. Log in to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Create a resource unit.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> CREATE RESOURCE UNIT box_16c96g MAX_CPU 16, MEMORY_SIZE = '5G', MAX_IOPS 10240, MIN_IOPS=10240;
   ```

   For more information about how to create a resource unit, see [Create a tenant](../../200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).

3. Create a resource pool.

   We recommend that you create a resource pool that is homogeneous with the resource pool of the source tenant, namely has the same number of resource units as the resource pool of the source tenant.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> CREATE RESOURCE POOL restore_pool unit = 'box_16c96g', unit_num = 1, zone_list = ('z1','z2','z3');
   ```

   For more information about how to create a resource pool, see [Create a tenant](../../200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).
