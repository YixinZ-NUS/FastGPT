# Application exceptions -- error messages without OceanBase error codes

During database operations, various exceptions may arise, such as application errors, connection issues, permission problems, resource limitations, and network disruptions. Among these, there are cases where an application exception occurs but the error message does not contain an OceanBase error code. This type of issue is generally more difficult to determine its relevance to the OceanBase database, which can lead to unclear troubleshooting directions.

To help you quickly identify the root cause and efficiently resolve such issues, this document outlines a clear and practical troubleshooting process for application exceptions where error messages do not include OceanBase error codes. This process provides explicit steps to improve troubleshooting efficiency and minimize business impact, supporting daily operations.

<!-- The troubleshooting process for application exceptions where error messages do not contain OceanBase error codes is as follows:

## Process description

When encountering application exceptions where error messages do not contain OceanBase error codes, follow this process for troubleshooting.

Analyze the application's error logic to determine whether it is a disconnection exception:

* If yes, refer to the [Application disconnection troubleshooting](1500.application-disconnection.md) document for troubleshooting.

* If no, further determine if the issue can be reproduced:

  * If yes, analyze the cause of the application error using methods such as code debugging and network packet analysis (such as tcpdump) to clarify the logic that triggers the problem and guide further analysis.

  * If no, attempt to deduce the cause of the error based on the available information and the application's logic to clarify the trigger and guide further analysis.

## Typical cases

:::tab
tab General (not mode-specific)

* The application reports an error: `Connection is closed & Connection reset` when importing large amounts of data.

* During testing in the test environment, the SQL average execution time was 2ms from the application side, but in the production environment, it increased to 30-40ms, while the SQL execution time in the database did not increase.

tab Oracle-compatible mode

* After switching the Oracle database to an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database, a JDBC application deployed with JBoss experienced insufficient connection count.
