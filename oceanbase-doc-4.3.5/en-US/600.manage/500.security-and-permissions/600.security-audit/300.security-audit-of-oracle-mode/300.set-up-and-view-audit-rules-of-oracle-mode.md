# Set and view auditing rules

After you enable security auditing, you must set specific auditing rules to audit user operations.

## Set auditing rules

Log in to the Oracle-compatible tenant as the `ORAAUDITOR` user. You can configure auditing rules by using the built-in auditing management user `ORAAUDITOR`. Auditing rules can be of the following types:

* Statement auditing: Audits operations performed by specific users or by all users, without specifying particular objects.
* Object auditing: Audits operations performed on specific objects by specific users or by all users.

Auditing rules are configured using the DDL statements `AUDIT` and `NOAUDIT`. Each auditing rule is a schema object.

For more information about setting auditing rules, see [AUDIT](../../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/300.dcl-of-oracle-mode/200.audit-of-oracle-mode.md).

For example, to audit all INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on the `tbl1` table owned by user `user1`:

```shell
obclient> AUDIT INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON user1.tbl1;
```

## View auditing rules

After you set auditing rules, you can view information about them using a series of Oracle-compatible data dictionary views.

| View | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ALL_DEF_AUDIT_OPTS](../../../../700.reference/700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/1000.all_def_audit_opts-of-oracle-mode.md) | Records default auditing rules for newly created objects. Column values are as follows:<ul><li><code>-/-</code>: Not audited by default</li><li><code>A/-</code>: Audited only when the operation succeeds</li><li><code>-/A</code>: Audited only when the operation fails</li><li><code>A/A</code>: Audited whether the operation succeeds or fails</li></ul> |
| [DBA_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS](../../../../700.reference/700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/20000.dba_stmt_audit_opts-of-oracle-mode.md) | Records detailed configurations for statement-level auditing. |
| [DBA_OBJ_AUDIT_OPTS](../../../../700.reference/700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/16900.dba_obj_audit_opts-of-oracle-mode.md) | Records detailed configurations for object-level auditing. |

The following example shows how to view auditing rules in the `ALL_DEF_AUDIT_OPTS` view:

```shell
obclient> SELECT * FROM SYS.ALL_DEF_AUDIT_OPTS;
```
