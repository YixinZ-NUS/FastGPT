# Audit specified database objects

OceanBase Database allows you to audit specific database objects and record only the specified operations performed on these objects. You can audit tables, sequences, and views.

## Audit operations performed by a single user on a database object

For example, audit insert operations performed by the `aud` user on the `tab1` table.

Log in as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and enable auditing.

```shell
obclient> AUDIT INSERT ON tab1 BY aud;
```

## Audit operations performed by all users on a database object

For example, audit failed INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations performed by all users on the `tab1` table.

Log in as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and enable auditing.

```shell
obclient> AUDIT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON tab1 WHENEVER NOT SUCCESSFUL;
```
