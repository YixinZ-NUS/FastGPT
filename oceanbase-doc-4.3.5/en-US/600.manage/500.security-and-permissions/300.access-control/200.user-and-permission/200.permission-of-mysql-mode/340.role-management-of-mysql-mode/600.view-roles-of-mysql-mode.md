# View roles

This topic describes how to view the activated roles of a user, roles granted to a role, and privileges of a role.

## View the roles and privileges granted to a user

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>A user can always use privileges that are directly granted, but can only use indirect privileges of an active role in a session. </p>
</main>

Use the following statement to view the roles and privileges granted to a user named `test1`:

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SHOW GRANTS FOR test1;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for test1@%                              |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'test1'                   |
| GRANT `employee`@`%`,`role1`@`%` TO `test1`@`%` |
+-------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set
```

If you want to view the privileges of a role granted to the `test1` user, use a `USING` clause.

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SHOW GRANTS FOR test1 USING role1;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for test1@%                              |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT ALTER SYSTEM ON *.* TO 'test1'            |
| GRANT UPDATE, SELECT ON `dbtest`.* TO 'test1'   |
| GRANT `employee`@`%`,`role1`@`%` TO `test1`@`%` |
+-------------------------------------------------+
3 rows in set
```

## View the roles and privileges granted to a role

Use the following statement to view the roles and privileges granted to a role named `role1`:

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SHOW GRANTS FOR role1;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for role1@%                                    |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT ALTER SYSTEM ON *.* TO 'role1'                  |
| GRANT SELECT ON `dbtest`.* TO 'role1'                 |
| GRANT SELECT ON `test1`.`tbl1` TO 'role1'             |
| GRANT `employee`@`%` TO `role1`@`%` WITH ADMIN OPTION |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
4 rows in set
```

## View the roles that become active by default when a user logs on

If you have specified to activate all roles granted to a user when the user logs on by using the global variable `activate_all_roles_on_login`, or have specified the roles that become active by default when the user logs on by using the `SET DEFAULT ROLE` or `ALTER USER` statement, you can query the `mysql.default_roles` view to check whether the settings are as expected.

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM mysql.default_roles;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+
| HOST | USER  | DEFAULT_ROLE_HOST | DEFAULT_ROLE_USER |
+------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+
| %    | test1 | %                 | role1             |
| %    | test1 | %                 | employee          |
+------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+
2 rows in set
```

For more information about the fields in the `mysql.default_roles` view, see [mysql.default_roles](../../../../../../700.reference/700.system-views/400.system-view-of-mysql-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-mysql-mode/3250.mysql-default_roles-of-mysql-mode.md).

## View the active roles in the current session

After you log in as a user, you can view your active roles in the current session by using the following statement:

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT current_role();
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+--------------------------------+
| current_role()                 |
+--------------------------------+
| `developer`@`%`,`employee`@`%` |
+--------------------------------+
1 row in set
```

If the query result is `NONE`, none of your roles are active. You can use only the privileges of an active role.

## View authorization relationships between roles and users

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM mysql.role_edges;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-------------------+
| FROM_HOST | FROM_USER | TO_HOST | TO_USER | WITH_ADMIN_OPTION |
+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-------------------+
| %         | employee  | %       | test2   | Y                 |
| %         | employee  | %       | role1   | Y                 |
| %         | developer | %       | test1   | N                 |
+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-------------------+
3 rows in set
```

The query result is described as follows:

* The first row indicates that all privileges of the `employee` role are granted to the `test2` user, who is allowed to grant the `employee` role to other users or roles.

* The second row indicates that all privileges of the `employee` role are granted to the `role1` role, who is allowed to grant the `employee` role to other users or roles.

* The third row indicates that all privileges of the `developer` role are granted to the `test1` user, who cannot grant the `developer` role to other users or roles.

For more information about the fields in the `mysql.role_edges` view, see [mysql.role_edges](../../../../../../700.reference/700.system-views/400.system-view-of-mysql-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-mysql-mode/3790.mysql-role_edges-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Query the table-level privileges of the currently activated roles

You can execute the following statement to view the table-level privileges of roles granted to the user and activated in the current session, as well as the table-level privileges of other roles granted to these roles:

```shell
obclient [information_schema]> SELECT * FROM information_schema.role_table_grants;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+---------+--------------+-----------+--------------+---------------+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------------+
| GRANTOR | GRANTOR_HOST | GRANTEE   | GRANTEE_HOST | TABLE_CATALOG | TABLE_SCHEMA | TABLE_NAME | PRIVILEGE_TYPE     | IS_GRANTABLE |
+---------+--------------+-----------+--------------+---------------+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------------+
| root    | %            | developer | %            | def           | test         | tbl2       | Drop,Update,Select | NO           |
+---------+--------------+-----------+--------------+---------------+--------------+------------+--------------------+--------------+
1 row in set
```

The query result indicates that the `root` user has granted the `Drop`, `Update`, and `Select` privileges on the table `test.tbl2` to the `developer` role.

For more information about the `role_table_grants` view, see [information_schema.role_table_grants](../../../../../../700.reference/700.system-views/400.system-view-of-mysql-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-mysql-mode/1710.information_schema-role-table-grants-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Query the column privileges of the currently activated roles

You can execute the following statement to view the column privileges of roles granted to the user and activated in the current session, as well as the column privileges of other roles granted to these roles:

```shell
obclient [information_schema]> SELECT * FROM information_schema.role_column_grants;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+---------+--------------+----------+--------------+---------------+--------------+------------+-------------+----------------+--------------+
| GRANTOR | GRANTOR_HOST | GRANTEE  | GRANTEE_HOST | TABLE_CATALOG | TABLE_SCHEMA | TABLE_NAME | COLUMN_NAME | PRIVILEGE_TYPE | IS_GRANTABLE |
+---------+--------------+----------+--------------+---------------+--------------+------------+-------------+----------------+--------------+
|    NULL |         NULL | employee | %            | def           | test          | tbl1      | c1          | Select,Insert  | NO           |
|    NULL |         NULL | employee | %            | def           | test          | tbl1      | c2          | Insert         | NO           |
+---------+--------------+----------+--------------+---------------+--------------+------------+-------------+----------------+--------------+
2 rows in set
```

In the preceding query result:

* The first row indicates that the `employee` role has the `Select` and `Insert` privileges on the `c1` column of the `test.tbl1` table.
* The second row indicates that the `employee` role has the `Insert` privilege on the `c2` column of the `test.tbl1` table.

For more information about the `role_column_grants` view, see [information_schema.role_column_grants](../../../../../../700.reference/700.system-views/400.system-view-of-mysql-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-mysql-mode/1720.information_schema-role-column-grants-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Query the routine privileges of the currently activated roles

You can execute the following statement to view the routine privileges of the roles granted to the user and activated in the current session, as well as the routine privileges of other roles granted to these roles:

```shell
obclient [information_schema]> SELECT * FROM information_schema.role_routine_grants;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+---------+--------------+-----------+--------------+------------------+-----------------+---------------+-----------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------------+--------------+
| GRANTOR | GRANTOR_HOST | GRANTEE   | GRANTEE_HOST | SPECIFIC_CATALOG | SPECIFIC_SCHEMA | SPECIFIC_NAME | ROUTINE_CATALOG | ROUTINE_SCHEMA | ROUTINE_NAME | PRIVILEGE_TYPE        | IS_GRANTABLE |
+---------+--------------+-----------+--------------+------------------+-----------------+---------------+-----------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------------+--------------+
| root    | %            | developer | %            | def              | test            | add_numbers   | def             | test           | add_numbers  | Execute,Alter Routine | NO           |
+---------+--------------+-----------+--------------+------------------+-----------------+---------------+-----------------+----------------+--------------+-----------------------+--------------+
1 row in set
```

The query result shows that the `root` user has granted the `Execute` and `Alter Routine` privileges on the `test.add_numbers` routine to the `developer` role.
