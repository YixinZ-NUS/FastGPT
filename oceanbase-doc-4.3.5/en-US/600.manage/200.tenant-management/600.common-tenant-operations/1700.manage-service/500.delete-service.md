# Delete a service

You can execute the `DELETE SERVICE` statement to delete a service not in use.

## Limitations

You cannot execute the `DELETE SERVICE` statement in a session created based on a service name.

## Prerequisites

You have the `ALTER SYSTEM` privilege.

## Procedure

1. Log in to a user tenant or the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the tenant administrator.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding parameters in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys#obdemo -p***** -A
   ```

2. Check whether the service to be deleted is in the `STOPPED` state.

   For more information, see [Query the service status](200.view-service-status.md).
  
   If the service is in the `STOPPED` state, you can directly delete it. Otherwise, you must stop it first. For more information, see [Stop a service](400.stop-service.md).

3. Delete the service.

   Here is an example:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM DELETE SERVICE service_name [TENANT [=] tenant_name];
   ```

   The parameters are described as follows:

   * `service_name`: the name of the service to be deleted.
   * `TENANT [=] tenant_name`: the name of the tenant for which you want to delete the service. This parameter is valid only in the `sys` tenant.

   Here are some examples:

   * Delete a service named `s_hz` for a tenant named `mysql_tenant` in the `sys` tenant.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM DELETE SERVICE s_hz TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

   * Delete a service named `s_hz` in a user tenant.

      ```shell
      obclient > ALTER SYSTEM DELETE SERVICE s_hz;
      ```
